Stars on eccentric orbits around a massive black hole (MBH) emit bursts of gravitational waves (GWs) at periapse Such events may be directly resolvable in the Galactic centre However if the star does not spiral in the emitted GWs are not resolvable for extra-galactic MBHs but constitute a source of background noise
We estimate the power spectrum of this extreme mass ratio burst background (EMBB) and compare it to the anticipated instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) To this end we model the regions close to a MBH accounting for mass-segregation and for processes that limit the presence of stars close to the MBH
such as GW inspiral and hydrodynamical collisions between stars We find that the EMBB is dominated by GW bursts from stellar mass black holes and the magnitude of the noise spectrum (f S_GW)^{1/2} is at least a factor ~10 smaller than the instrumental noise As an additional result of our analysis
In a previous paper (Gayon &amp; Bois 2008a) we have shown the general efficiency of retrograde resonances for stabilizing compact planetary systems Such retrograde resonances can be found when two-planets of a three-body planetary system are both in mean motion resonance and revolve in opposite directions For a particular two-planet system
we have also obtained a new orbital fit involving such a counter-revolving configuration and consistent with the observational data <br>In the present paper we analytically investigate the three-body problem in this particular case of retrograde resonances We therefore define a new set of canonical variables allowing to express correctly the resonance angles and obtain the Hamiltonian of a system harboring planets revolving in opposite directions
We perform a linear analysis to investigate the dynamical response of a non-synchronized hot Jupiter to stellar irradiation In this work we consider the diurnal Fourier harmonic of the stellar irradiation acting at the top of a radiative layer of a hot Jupiter with no clouds and winds In the absence of the Coriolis force
the diurnal thermal forcing can excite internal waves propagating into the planet&#39;s interior when the thermal forcing period is longer than the sound crossing time of the planet&#39;s surface When the Coriolis effect is taken into consideration the latitude-dependent stellar heating can excite weak internal waves (g modes) and/or strong baroclinic Rossby waves (buoyant r modes) depending on the asynchrony of the planet
When the planet spins faster than its orbital motion (i e retrograde thermal forcing) these waves carry negative angular momentum and are damped by radiative loss as they propagate downwards from the upper layer of the radiative zone As a result angular momentum is transferred from the lower layer of the radiative zone to the upper layer and generates a vertical shear
Recent research has shown that distinct physical regions in the Venusian induced magnetosphere are recognizable from the variations of strength of the magnetic field and its wave/fluctuation activity In this paper the statistical properties of magnetic fluctuations are investigated in the Venusian magnetosheath and wake regions The main goal is to identify the characteristic scaling features of fluctuations along Venus Express (VEX) trajectory and to understand the specific circumstances of the occurrence of different types of scalings
For the latter task we also use the results of measurements from the previous missions to Venus Our main result is that the changing character of physical interactions between the solar wind and the planetary obstacle is leading to different types of spectral scaling in the near-Venusian space Noisy fluctuations are observed in the magnetosheath
wavy structures near the terminator and in the nightside near-planet wake Multi-scale turbulence is observed at the magnetosheath boundary layer and near the quasi-parallel bow shock Magnetosheath boundary layer turbulence is associated with an average magnetic field which is nearly aligned with the Sun-Venus line Noisy magnetic fluctuations are well described with the Gaussian statistics
We revisit the tidal stability of extrasolar systems harboring a transiting planet and demonstrate that independently of any tidal model none but one (HAT-P-2b) of these planets has a tidal equilibrium state which implies ultimately a collision of these objects with their host star Consequently conventional circularization and synchronization timescales cannot be defined because the corresponding states do not represent the endpoint of the tidal evolution
Using numerical simulations of the coupled tidal equations for the spin and orbital parameters of each transiting planetary system we confirm these predictions and show that the orbital eccentricity and the stellar obliquity do not follow the usually assumed exponential relaxation but instead decrease significantly reaching eventually a zero value
only during the final runaway merging of the planet with the star The only characteristic evolution timescale of {\it all} rotational and orbital parameters is the lifetime of the system which crucially depends on the magnitude of tidal dissipation within the star These results imply that the nearly circular orbits of transiting planets and the alignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit are unlikely to be due to tidal dissipation
We report the discovery of a minor planet (2006 SQ372) on an orbit with a perihelion of 24 AU and a semimajor axis of 796 AU Dynamical simulations show that this is a transient orbit and is unstable on a timescale of 200 Myrs Falling near the upper semimajor axis range of the scattered disk and the lower semimajor axis range of the Oort Cloud
previous membership in either class is possible By modeling the production of similar orbits from the Oort Cloud as well as from the scattered disk we find that the Oort Cloud produces 16 times as many objects on SQ372-like orbits as the scattered disk Given this result we believe this to be the most distant long-period comet ever discovered
Precise radial-velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph reveal the presence of two planets orbiting the solar-type star HD45364 The companion masses are 0 187 Mjup and 0 658 Mjup with semi-major axes of 0 681 AU and 0 897 AU and eccentricities of 0 168 and 0 097 respectively A dynamical analysis of the system further shows a 3
which prevents close encounters and ensures the stability of the system over 5 Gyr This is the first time that such a resonant configuration has been observed for extra-solar planets although there is an analogue in our Solar System formed by Neptune and Pluto This singular planetary system may provide important constraints on planetary formation and migration scenarios
Direct imaging searches have begun to detect planetary and brown dwarf companions and to place constraints on the presence of giant planets at large separations from their host star This work helps to motivate such planet searches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could be detectable by direct imaging campaigns
Both the classical core accretion and the gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard-pressed to form long-period planets in situ Here we show that dynamical instabilities among planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets much closer to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large (~100 AU - 100000 AU) separations
We estimate the limits within which these planets may survive quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering into both stable and unstable wide orbits and demonstrate that population analyses must take into account the age of the system We predict that planet scattering creates a population of detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreases in number on timescales of ~10 Myr
(Abridged) Wavelet analysis can be used to measure the power spectrum of solar wind fluctuations along a line in any direction with respect to the local mean magnetic field This technique is applied to study solar wind turbulence in high-speed streams in the ecliptic plane near solar minimum using magnetic field measurements with a cadence of eight vectors per second
The analysis of nine high-speed streams shows that the reduced spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations (trace power) is approximately azimuthally symmetric about B_0 in both the inertial range and dissipation range; in the inertial range the spectra are characterized by a power-law exponent that changes continuously from 1 6 \pm 0
The potentially hazardous asteroid (101955) 1999 RQ36 has the possibility of collision with the Earth in the latter half of the 22nd century well beyond the traditional 100-year time horizon for routine impact monitoring The probabilities accumulate to a total impact probability of approximately 10E-3 with a pair of closely related routes to impact in 2182 comprising more than half of the total
The analysis of impact possibilities so far in the future is strongly dependent on the action of the Yarkovsky effect which raises new challenges in the careful assessment of longer term impact hazards <br>Even for asteroids with very precisely determined orbits a future close approach to Earth can scatter the possible trajectories to the point that the problem becomes like that of a newly discovered asteroid with a weakly determined orbit
If the scattering takes place late enough so that the target plane uncertainty is dominated by Yarkovsky accelerations then the thermal properties of the asteroid which are typically unknown play a major role in the impact assessment In contrast if the strong planetary interaction takes place sooner while the Yarkovsky dispersion is still relatively small compared to that derived from the measurements
We report on the discovery of HAT-P-11b the smallest radius transiting extrasolar planet (TEP) discovered from the ground and the first hot Neptune discovered to date by transit searches HAT-P-11b orbits the bright (V=9 587) and metal rich ([Fe=H] = +0 31 +/- 0 05) K4 dwarf star GSC 03561-02092 with P = 4
We present a global analysis of the available photometric and radial-velocity data that result in stellar and planetary parameters with simultaneous treatment of systematic variations The planet like its near-twin GJ 436b is somewhat larger than Neptune (17Mearth 3 8Rearth) both in mass Mp = 0 081 +/- 0 009 MJ (25
HAT-P-11b orbits in an eccentric orbit with e = 0 198 +/- 0 046 and omega = 355 2 +/- 17 3 causing a reflex motion of its parent star with amplitude 11 6 +/- 1 2 m/s a challenging detection due to the high level of chromospheric activity of the parent star
Our ephemeris for the transit events is Tc = 2454605 89132 +/- 0 00032 (BJD) with duration 0 0957 +/- 0 0012 d and secondary eclipse epoch of 2454608 96 +/- 0 15 d (BJD) The basic stellar parameters of the host star are M* = 0 809+0 020-0 027 Msun
R* = 0 752 +/- 0 021 Rsun and Teff = 4780 +/- 50 K Importantly HAT-P-11 will lie on one of the detectors of the forthcoming Kepler mission We discuss an interesting constraint on the eccentricity of the system by the transit light curve and stellar parameters We also present a blend analysis
Time-dependent insolation in a planetary atmosphere induces a mass quadrupole upon which the stellar tidal acceleration can exert a force This &#34;thermal tide&#34; force can give rise to secular torques on the planet and orbit as well as radial forces causing eccentricity evolution We apply this idea to the close-in gas giant exoplanets (&#34;hot Jupiters&#34;)
The response of radiative atmospheres is computed in a hydrostatic model which treats the insolation as a time-dependent heat source and solves for thermal radiation using flux-limited diffusion Fully nonlinear numerical simulations are compared to solutions of the linearized equations as well as analytic approximations all of which are in good agreement
We find generically that thermal tide density perturbations {\it lead} the semi-diurnal forcing As a result thermal tides can generate asynchronous spin and eccentricity Our results are as follows (1) Departure from synchronous spin is significant for hot Jupiters and increases with orbital period (2) Ongoing gravitational tidal dissipation in spin equilibrium leads to steady-state internal heating rates up to $\sim 10^{28} {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$
If deposited sufficiently deep these heating rates may explain the anomalously large radii of many hot Jupiters in terms of a &#34;tidal main sequence&#34; where cooling balances tidal heating At fixed stellar type planet mass and tidal $Q$ planetary radius increases strongly toward the star inside orbital periods $\la 2$ weeks
The rotation of Mercury is presently captured in a 3/2 spin-orbit resonance with the orbital mean motion The capture mechanism is well understood as the result of tidal interactions with the Sun combined with planetary perturbations However it is now almost certain that Mercury has a liquid core which should induce a contribution of viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary to the spin evolution
This last effect greatly increases the chances of capture in all spin-orbit resonances being 100% for the 2/1 resonance and thus preventing the planet from evolving to the presently observed configuration Here we show that for a given resonance as the chaotic evolution of Mercury&#39;s orbit can drive its eccentricity to very low values during the planet&#39;s history
any previous capture can be destabilized whenever the eccentricity becomes lower than a critical value In our numerical integrations of 1000 orbits of Mercury over 4 Gyr the spin ends 99 8% of the time captured in a spin-orbit resonance in particular in one of the following three configurations 5/2 (22%)
Although the present 3/2 spin-orbit resonance is not the most probable outcome we also show that the capture probability in this resonance can be increased up to 55% or 73% if the eccentricity of Mercury in the past has descended below the critical values 0 025 or 0 005 respectively
Radial Velocity follow-up is essential to establish or exclude the planetary nature of a transiting companion as well as to accurately determine its mass Here we present some elements of an efficient Doppler follow-up strategy based on high-resolution spectroscopy devoted to the characterization of transiting candidates Some aspects and results of the radial velocity follow-up of the CoRoT space mission are presented in order to illustrate the strategy used to deal with the zoo of transiting candidates
Based on millimeter-wavelength continuum observations we suggest that the recent &#39;spectacle&#39; of comet 17P/Holmes can be explained by a thick air-tight dust cover and the effects of H2O sublimation which started when the comet arrived at the heliocentric distance &lt;= 2 5 AU The porous structure inside the nucleus provided enough surface for additional sublimation
which eventually led to the break up of the dust cover and to the observed outburst The magnitude of the particle burst can be explained by the energy provided by insolation stored in the dust cover and the nucleus within the months before the outburst the subliming surface within the nucleus is more than one order of magnitude larger than the geometric surface of the nucleus -- possibly an indication of the latter&#39;s porous structure
We examine the effect of giant planet migration on the formation of inner terrestrial planet systems We consider situations in which the giant planet halts migration at semi-major axes in the range 0 13 - 1 7 AU due to gas disk dispersal An N-body code is employed that is linked to a viscous gas disk algorithm capable of simulating
gas loss via accretion onto the central star and photoevaporation; gap formation by the giant planet; type II migration of the giant; optional type I migration of protoplanets; gas drag on planetesimals We find that most of the inner system planetary building blocks survive the passage of the giant planet
either by being shepherded inward or scattered into exterior orbits Systems of one or more hot-Earths are predicted to form and remain interior to the giant planet especially if type II migration has been limited or where type I migration has affected protoplanetary dynamics Habitable planets in low eccentricity warm-Jupiter systems appear possible if the giant planet makes a limited incursion into the outer regions of the habitable zone (HZ)
We show that a simple modified version of the Magnetorotational Instability (MRI) can develop in the outer liquid core of the Earth in the presence of a background shear It requires either thermal wind or a primary instability such as convection to drive a weak differential rotation within the core
The force balance in the Earth&#39;s core is very unlike classical astrophysical applications of the MRI (such as gaseous disks around stars) Here the weak differential rotation in the Earth core yields an instability by its constructive interaction with the planet&#39;s much larger rotation rate The resulting destabilising mechanism is just strong enough to counteract stabilizing resistive effects
Context Pluto possesses a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen in which the detection of methane has been reported <br>Aims The goal is to constrain essential but so far unknown parameters of Pluto&#39;s atmosphere such as the surface pressure lower atmosphere thermal stucture and methane mixing ratio <br>Methods We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of gaseous methane
and a novel analysis of occultation light-curves <br>Results We show that (i) Pluto&#39;s surface pressure is currently in the 6 5-24 microbar range (ii) the methane mixing ratio is 0 5+/-0 1 % adequate to explain Pluto&#39;s inverted thermal structure and ~100 K upper atmosphere temperature (iii) a troposphere is not required by our data
but if present it has a depth of at most 17 km i e less than one pressure scale height; in this case methane is supersaturated in most of it The atmospheric and bulk surface abundance of methane are strikingly similar a possible consequence of the presence of a CH4-rich top surface layer
We report the discovery of WASP-6b an inflated sub-Jupiter mass planet transiting every 3 3610060 +0 0000022-0 0000035 days a mildly metal-poor solar-type star of magnitude V=11 9 A combined analysis of the WASP photometry high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocities yield a planetary mass M_p = 0 503 +0
resulting in a density rho_p = 0 27 +-0 05 rho_jup The mass and radius for the host star are M_s = 0 88 +0 05-0 08 M_sun and R_s = 0 870 +0 025-0 036 R_sun The non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0 054 +0 018-0 015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidal heating ~1 Gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius
We study the light scattering properties of random ballistic aggregates constructed in Shen et al (Paper I) Using the discrete-dipole-approximation we compute the scattering phase function and linear polarization for random aggregates with various sizes and porosities and with two different compositions 100% silicate and 50% silicate-50% graphite We investigate the dependence of light scattering properties on wavelength
cluster size and porosity using these aggregate models We find that while the shape of the phase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates the linear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of the aggregates with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases
Contrary to previous studies we argue that monomer size has negligible effects on the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates as long as the constituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to 2*pi*a_0/lambda\sim 1 6 where a_0 is the monomer radius Previous claims for such monomer size effects are in fact the combined effects of size parameter and porosity
Finally we present aggregate models that can reproduce the phase function and polarization of scattered light from the AU Mic debris disk and from cometary dust including the negative polarization observed for comets at scattering angles 160&lt;theta&lt;180 deg These aggregates have moderate porosities P\sim 0 6 and are of sub-micron-size for the debris disk case
[This cometary occultation observation from June 1983 remained to be formally reported due to other preoccupations of the authors It was presented in seminars to colleagues at Ooty Bangalore and elsewhere We now write it up as we have been asked about it by various colleagues at various times and feel we owe it to them to put it firmly on record
] We planned and observed with Ooty Radio Telescope the occultation with Comet 1983e Sugano-Saigusa-Fujikawa of the extragalactic radio source 2019+098 = 3C411 The results are presented formally for the first time along with a brief account of other cometary occultations and general background of planning execution and interpretation of such observations which will be useful for other future observers
The occultation occurred at 07 52 IST on 12th June 1983 It amounted to 25% peak to peak fluctuation in the flux density of the radio source The rough predicted occultation time was 07 24 IST We interpret the results after refining the occultation time to allow for various effects
One of the longstanding debates in the history of paleontology focuses on the issue of whether or not there have been long term cycles (operating over tens of millions of years) in biodiversity and extinction Here we consider the history of this debate by connecting the skein from Grabau up to 2008
We focus on the evidence for periodicity that has emerged thus far and conclude that there is indeed some evidence that periodicity may be real though of course more work is needed We also comment on possible causal mechanisms focusing especially on the motion of our solar system in the Galaxy
The aim of this paper is to study the vertical profile of small dust particles in protoplanetary discs in which angular momentum transport is due to MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability We consider particle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few <a href="http //millimeters
We" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> use a grid--based MHD code to perform global two-fluid simulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of various sizes In quasi--steady state the gravitational settling of dust particles is balanced by turbulent diffusion Simple and standard models of this process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust density
The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns in size) especially in the disc upper layers ($Z&gt;3H$ where $H$ is the scale-height) Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement between the simple model predictions and the simulation results This is because MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs
since velocity fluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly magnetized corona develops We provide an alternative model that gives a better fit to the simulations In this model dust particles are diffused away from the midplane by MHD turbulence but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically and is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical velocity fluctuations
The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used to trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs such as the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations In the future detailed and direct comparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful tool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs
We report on the detection of the secondary eclipse of the very-hot Jupiter OGLE-TR-56b from combined z-band time series photometry obtained with the VLT and Magellan telescopes We measure a flux decrement of 0 0363+/-0 0091 percent from the combined Magellan and VLT datasets which indicates a blackbody brightness temperature of 2718 (+127/-107) K
a very low albedo and a small incident radiation redistribution factor indicating a lack of strong winds in the planet&#39;s atmosphere The measured secondary depth is consistent with thermal emission but our precision is not sufficient to distinguish between a black-body emitting planet or emission as predicted by models with strong optical absorbers such as TiO/VO
We consider the solid-solid interactions in the two body problem The relative equilibria have been previously studied analytically and general motions were numerically analyzed using some expansion of the gravitational potential up to the second order but only when there are no direct interactions between the orientation of the bodies
Here we expand the potential up to the fourth order and we show that the secular problem obtained after averaging over fast angles as for the precession model of Boue and Laskar [Boue G Laskar J 2006 Icarus 185 312-330] is integrable but not trivially We describe the general features of the motions and we provide explicit analytical approximations for the solutions
We demonstrate that the general solution of the secular system can be decomposed as a uniform precession around the total angular momentum and a periodic symmetric orbit in the precessing frame More generally we show that for a general n-body system of rigid bodies in gravitational interaction the regular quasiperiodic solutions can be decomposed into a uniform precession around the total angular momentum
Comet NEAT C/2001 Q4 was observed for linear polarization using the optical polarimeter mounted at the 1 2m telescope at Mt Abu Observatory during the months of May and June 2004 Observations were conducted through the International Halley Watch narrow band (continuum) and B V R broad band filters During the observing run the phase angle ranged from 85
As expected polarization increases with wavelength in this phase angle range Polarization colour in the narrow bands changes at different epochs perhaps related to cometary activity or molecular emission contamination The polarization was also measured in the cometary coma at different locations along a line in the direction of the tail
Among the icy satellites of Saturn Iapetus shows a striking dichotomy between its leading and trailing hemispheres the former being significantly darker than the latter Thanks to the VIMS imaging spectrometer on-board Cassini it is now possible to investigate the spectral features of the satellites in Saturn system within a wider spectral range and with an enhanced accuracy than with previously available data
In this work we present an application of the G-mode method to the high resolution visible and near infrared data of Phoebe Iapetus and Hyperion collected by Cassini/VIMS to search for compositional correlations We also present the results of a dynamical study on the efficiency of Iapetus in capturing dust grains travelling inward in Saturn system to evaluate the viability of Poynting-Robertson drag as the physical mechanism transferring the dark material to the satellite
The results of spectroscopic classification are used jointly with the ones of the dynamical study to describe a plausible physical scenario for the origin of Iapetus&#39; dichotomy Our work shows that mass transfer from the outer Saturnian system is an efficient mechanism particularly for the range of sizes hypothesised for the particles composing the newly discovered outer ring around Saturn
We provide a preliminary estimate of the performance of reflex astrometry on Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars In Monte Carlo experiments we analyze large samples of astrometric data sets with low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios We treat the idealized case of a single planet orbiting a single star
and assume there are no non-Keplerian complications or uncertainties The real case can only be more difficult We use periodograms for discovery and least-squares fits for estimating the Keplerian parameters We find a completeness for detection compatible with estimates in the literature We find mass estimation by least squares to be biased
as has been found for noisy radial-velocity data sets; this bias degrades the completeness of accurate mass estimation When we compare the true planetary position with the position predicted from the fitted orbital parameters at future times we find low completeness for an accuracy goal of 0 3 times the semimajor axis of the planet
even with no delay following the end of astrometric observations Our findings suggest that the recommendation of the ExoPlanet Task Force (Lunine et al 2008) for &#34;the capability to measure convincingly wobble semi-amplitudes down to 0 2 $\mu$as integrated over the mission lifetime &#34; may not be satisfied by an instrument characterized by the noise floor of the Space Interferometry Mission
$\sigma_\mathrm{floor}\approx0 035\mu$as An important unsolved strategic challenge for the exoplanetary science program is figuring out how to predict the future position of an Earth-like planet with accuracy sufficient to ensure the efficiency and success of the science operations for follow-on spectroscopy which would search for biologically significant molecules in the atmosphere
Since 2004 observations of Saturn&#39;s F ring have revealed that the ring&#39;s core is surrounded by structures with radial scales of hundreds of kilometers called &#34;spirals&#34; and &#34;jets&#34; Gravitational scattering by nearby moons was suggested as a potential production mechanism; however it remained doubtful because a population of Prometheus-mass moons is needed and
obviously such a population does not exist in the F ring region We investigate here another mechanism dissipative physical collisions of kilometer-size moonlets (or clumps) with the F-ring core We show that it is a viable and efficient mechanism for producing spirals and jets provided that massive moonlets are embedded in the F-ring core and that they are impacted by loose clumps orbiting in the F ring region
which could be consistent with recent data from ISS VIMS and UVIS We show also that coefficients of restitution as low as ~0 1 are needed to reproduce the radial extent of spirals and jets suggesting that collisions are very dissipative in the F ring region In conclusion spirals and jets would be the direct manifestation the ongoing collisional activity of the F ring region
One possible diagnostic of planet formation orbital migration and tidal evolution is the angle psi between a planet&#39;s orbital axis and the spin axis of its parent star In general psi cannot be measured but for transiting planets one can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
Here we show how to combine measurements of lambda in different systems to derive statistical constraints on psi We apply the method to 11 published measurements of lambda using two different single-parameter distributions to describe the ensemble First assuming a Rayleigh distribution (or more precisely a Fisher distribution on a sphere)
we find that the peak value is less than 22 degrees with 95% confidence Second assuming a fraction f of the orbits have random orientations relative to the stars and the remaining fraction (1-f) are perfectly aligned we find f&lt;0 36 with 95% confidence This latter model fits the data better than the Rayleigh distribution
In agreement with previous work we show that the presence of the short-lived radionuclide Al-26 in the early Solar System was unlikely (&lt;2% a priori probability) to be the result of direct introduction of supernova ejecta into the gaseous disk during the Class II stage of protosolar evolution We also show that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal star cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory of the Solar System
These results are consistent with the absence of the oxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova ejecta into the protoplanetary disk Instead the presence of Al-26 in the oldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its apparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of (4
We propose that this radionuclide originated in a prior generation of massive stars that formed in the same host molecular cloud as the Sun and contaminated that cloud by Wolf-Rayet winds We calculated the Galactic distribution of Al-26/Al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using the established embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions
published nucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars and by assuming rapid and uniform mixing into the cloud Although our model predicts that the majority of stellar systems contain no Al-26 from massive stars and that the a priori probability that the Al-26/Al-27 ratio will reach or exceed the canonical Solar System value is only ~6%
The evolution of the particle background at an altitude of ~540 km during the time interval between 1996 and 2007 is studied using the particle monitor of the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment on board NASA&#39;s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer A special emphasis of this study is the location and strength of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)
The size and strength of the SAA are anti-correlated with the the 10 7 cm radio flux of the Sun which leads the SAA strength by ~1 year reflecting variations in solar heating of the upper atmosphere The location of the SAA is also found to drift westwards with an average drift rate of about 0
Superimposed to this drift rate are irregularities where the SAA suddenly moves eastwards and where furthermore the speed of the drift changes The most prominent of these irregularities is found in the second quarter of 2003 and another event took place in 1999 We suggest that these events are previously unrecognized manifestations of the geomagnetic jerks of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field
It has been suggested that shock waves in the solar nebula formed the high temperature materials observed in meteorites and comets It is shown that the temperatures at the inner rim of the solar nebula could have been high enough over a sufficient length of time to produce chondrules CAIs
refractory dust grains and other high-temperature materials observed in comets and meteorites <br>The solar bipolar jet flow may have produced an enrichment of 16O in the solar nebula over time and the chondrule oxygen isotopic reservoirs are possibly due to temporal changes in the relative position of the inner edge of the solar nebula and the subsequent strength of the solar bipolar jet flow
We present photometry of two transits of the giant planet WASP-4b with a photometric precision of 400-800 parts per million and a time sampling of 25-40 seconds The two midtransit times are determined to within 6 seconds Together with previously published times the data are consistent with a constant orbital period
giving no compelling evidence for period variations that would be produced by a satellite or additional planets Analysis of the new photometry in combination with stellar-evolutionary modeling gives a planetary mass and radius of 1 237 +/- 0 064 M_jup and 1 365 +/- 0 021 R_jup The planet is 15% larger than expected based on previously published models of solar-composition giant planets
Previous studies have shown that extrasolar Earth-like planets in close-in habitable zones around M-stars are weakly protected against galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) leading to a strongly increased particle flux to the top of the planetary atmosphere Two main effects were held responsible for the weak shielding of such an exoplanet
(a) For a close-in planet the planetary magnetic moment is strongly reduced by tidal locking Therefore such a close-in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere (b) The small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar wind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances
This dense stellar wind leads to additional compression of the magnetosphere which can further reduce the shielding efficiency against GCRs In this work we analyse and compare the effect of (a) and (b) showing that the stellar wind variation with orbital distance has little influence on the cosmic ray shielding
Instead the weak shielding of M star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment We further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the planetary magnetic moment and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency We show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against galactic cosmic rays
The transiting &#34;hot Saturn&#34; HD 149026b which has the highest mean density of any confirmed planet in the Neptune-Jupiter mass range has challenged theories of planet formation since its discovery in 2005 Previous investigations could not explain the origin of the planet&#39;s 45-110 Earth-mass solid core without invoking catastrophes such as gas giant collisions or heavy planetesimal bombardment launched by neighboring planets
Here we show that HD 149026b&#39;s large core can be successfully explained by the standard core accretion theory of planet formation The keys to our reconstruction of HD 149026b are (1) applying a model of the solar nebula to describe the protoplanet nursery; (2) placing the planet initially on a long-period orbit at Saturn&#39;s heliocentric distance of 9
As accretion in protoplanetary disks is enabled by turbulent viscosity the border between active and inactive (dead) zones constitutes a location where there is an abrupt change in the accretion flow The gas accumulation that ensues triggers the Rossby wave instability that in turn saturates into anticyclonic vortices It was suggested that the trapping of solids within them leads to a burst of planet formation on very short timescales
We perform two-dimensional global simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a non-magnetized thin protoplanetary disk with the Pencil Code We use multiple particle species of radius 1 10 30 and 100 cm solving for the particles&#39; gravitational interaction by a particle-mesh method The dead zone is modeled as a region of low viscosity
Adiabatic and locally isothermal equations of state are used We find that the Rossby wave instability is triggered under a variety of conditions thus making vortex formation a robust process Inside the vortices fast accumulation of solids occurs and the particles collapse into objects of planetary mass in timescales as short as five orbits
Because the drag force is size-dependent aerodynamical sorting ensues within the vortical motion and the first bound structures formed are composed primarily of similarly-sized particles In addition to erosion due to ram pressure we identify gas tides from the massive vortices as a disrupting agent of formed protoplanetary embryos We also estimate the collisional velocity history of the particles that compose the most massive embryo by the end of the simulation
The so-called Vegetation Red-Edge (VRE) a sharp increase in the reflectance around $700 nm$ is a characteristic of vegetation spectra and can therefore be used as a biomarker if it can be detected in an unresolved extrasolar Earth-like planet integrated reflectance spectrum Here we investigate the potential for detection of vegetation spectra during the last Quaternary climatic extrema
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene optimum for which past climatic simulations have been made By testing the VRE detectability during these extrema when Earth&#39;s climate and biomes maps were different from today we are able to test the vegetation detectability on a terrestrial planet different from our modern Earth
Data from the Biome3 5 model have been associated to visible GOME spectra for each biome and cloud cover to derive Earth&#39;s integrated spectra for given Earth phases and observer positions The VRE is then measured Results show that the vegetation remains detectable during the last climatic extrema Compared to current Earth
the Holocene optimum with a greener Sahara slightly increases the mean VRE on one hand while on the other hand the large ice cap over the northern Hemisphere during the LGM decreases vegetation detectability We finally discuss the detectability of the VRE in the context of recently proposed space missions
Whereas the Solar System has Mars and Europa as the best candidates for finding fossil/extant life as we know it - based on complex carbon compounds and liquid water - the 263 (non-pulsar) planetary systems around other stars as known at 15 September 2008 could between them possess many more planets where life might exist
Moreover the number of these exoplanetary systems is growing steadily and with this growth there is an increase in the number of planets that could bear carbon-liquid water life In this brief review the main methods by which exoplanets are being discovered are outlined and then the discoveries that have so far been made are presented
Habitability is then discussed and an outline presented of how a planet could be studied from afar to determine whether it is habitable and whether it is indeed inhabited This review is aimed at the astrobiology community which spans many disciplines few of which involve exoplanets It is therefore at a basic level and concentrates on the major topics
Recent observations of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b did not reveal the presence of water in the emission spectrum of the planet Yet models of such &#39;Hot Jupiter&#39; planets predict an abundance of atmospheric water vapour Validating and constraining these models is crucial for understanding the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments
Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of HD 189733b have recently been found in transmission spectra where the planet&#39;s atmosphere selectively absorbs the light of the parent star and in broadband photometry Here we report on the detection of strong water absorption in a high signal-to-noise mid-infrared emission spectrum of the planet itself
We find both a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 microns and discrete spectral features that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour The differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit the possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structures might alter the emission spectrum over time
The spectral region around 10 micrometer showing prominent dust emission bands is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary dust Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose but so far no comparative test has been performed to test their validity We calculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central sources
using a 2D radiative transfer code These spectra were then fitted in a blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods We studied the effect of disk structure (flared vs flat) inclination angle size of the inner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition Our results show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate systematically from the real chemical composition
Out of the four tested spectral decomposition methods our new two-layer temperature distribution method differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show the weakest systematic effects The reason for the deviations of the results given by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e g single average grain temperature or one component continuum)
We also tested the influence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral decomposition methods We find that for ground-based observations (8-13 micrometer) the expected uncertainty in the value of the crystallinity is about 11% for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 while for space-based observations (7-17 micrometer) the uncertainty is about 5%
In the context of current and future microwave surveys mainly dedicated to the accurate mapping of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) mm and sub-mm emissions from Solar System will represent a potential source of contamination as well as an opportunity for new Solar System studies In particular the forthcoming ESA Planck mission will be able to observe the point-like thermal emission from planets and some large asteroids as well as the diffused Zodiacal Light Emission (ZLE)
We report on observations of transit events of the transiting planets XO-1b and TrES-1 with the AIU Jena telescope in Grossschwabhausen Based on our IR photometry (in March 2007) and available transit timings (SuperWASP XO and TLC-project-data) we improved the orbital period of XO-1b (P = 3 941497$\pm$0 000006) and TrES-1 (P = 3
We report the discovery of a low-density exoplanet transiting an 11th magnitude star in the Southern hemisphere WASP-15b which orbits its host star with a period P=3 7520656+-0 0000028d has a mass M_p=0 542+-0 050M_J and radius R_p=1 428+-0 077R_J and is therefore the one of least dense transiting exoplanets so far discovered (rho_p=0
We report the first attempt to observe the secondary eclipse of a transiting extra-solar planet at radio wavelengths We observed HD 189733 b with the Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope of the NRAO over about 5 5 hours before during and after secondary eclipse at frequencies of 307 - 347 MHz
In this frequency range we determine the 3-sigma upper limit to the flux density to be 81 mJy The data are consistent with no eclipse or a marginal reduction in flux at the time of secondary eclipse in all subsets of our bandwidth; the strongest signal is an apparent eclipse at the 2-sigma level in the 335
Based on a suite of Monte Carlo simulations I show that a stellar-mass dependent lifetime of the gas disks from which planets form can explain the lack of hot Jupiters/close-in giant planets around high-mass stars and other key features of the observed semimajor axis distribution of radial velocity-detected giant planets
Using reasonable parameters for the Type II migration rate regions of planet formation and timescales for gas giant core formation I construct synthetic distributions of jovian planets A planet formation/migration model assuming a stellar mass-dependent gas disk lifetime reproduces key features in the observed distribution by preferentially stranding planets around high-mass stars at large semimajor axes
To study the evolution of protoplanetary dust aggregates we performed experiments with up to 2600 collisions between single highly-porous dust aggregates and a solid plate The dust aggregates consisted of spherical SiO$_2$ grains with 1 5$\mu$m diameter and had an initial volume filling factor (the volume fraction of material) of $\phi_0=0
The aggregates were put onto a vibrating baseplate and thus performed multiple collisions with the plate at a mean velocity of 0 2 m s$^{-1}$ The dust aggregates were observed by a high-speed camera to measure their size which apparently decreased over time as a measure for their compaction After 1000 collisions the volume filling factor was increased by a factor of two
while after $\sim2000$ collisions it converged to an equilibrium of $\phi\approx0 36$ In few experiments the aggregate fragmented although the collision velocity was well below the canonical fragmentation threshold of $\sim1$ m s$^{-1}$ The compaction of the aggregate has an influence on the surface-to-mass ratio and thereby the dynamic behavior and relative velocities of dust aggregates in the protoplanetary nebula
Newly-formed planetary systems with ages of &lt;10 Myr offer many unique insights into the formation evolution and fundamental properties of extrasolar planets These planets have fallen beyond the limits of past surveys but as we enter the next decade we stand on the threshold of several crucial advances in instrumentation and observing techniques that will finally unveil this critical population
In this white paper we consider several classes of planets (inner gas giants outer gas giants and ultrawide planetary-mass companions) and summarize the motivation for their study the the observational tests that will distinguish between competing theoretical models and the infrastructure investments and policy choices that will best enable future discovery
We propose that there are two fundamental questions that must be addressed 1) Do planets form via core accretion gravitational instability or a combination of the two methods? 2) What do the atmospheres an interiors of young planets look like and does the mass-luminosity relation of young planets more closely resemble the &#34;hot start&#34; or &#34;cold start&#34; models? To address these questions
we recommend investment in high-resolution NIR spectrographs (existing and new) support for innovative new techniques and pathfinder surveys for directly-imaged young exoplanets and continued investment in visible-light adaptive optics to allow full characterization of wide &#34;planetary-mass&#34; companions for calibrating planet evolutionary models In summary testing newly proposed planet formation and evolutionary predictions will require the identification of a large population of young (&lt;10 Myr) planets whose orbital
We explore the properties of cold gravitoturbulent accretion disks - non-fragmenting disks hovering on the verge of gravitational instability - using a realistic prescription for the effective viscosity caused by gravitational torques This prescription is based on a direct relationship between the angular momentum transport in a thin accretion disk and the disk cooling in a steady state
Assuming that opacity is dominated by dust we are able to self-consistently derive disk properties for a given $\dot M$ assuming marginal gravitational stability We also allow external irradiation of the disk and account for a non-zero background viscosity which can be due to the MRI Spatial transitions between different co-existing disk states (e
g between irradiated and self-luminous or between gravitoturbulent and viscous) are described and the location of the boundary at which disk must fragment is determined in a variety of situations We demonstrate in particular that at low enough $\dot M$ external irradiation stabilizes gravitoturbulent disk against fragmentation all the way to infinity thus providing means of steady mass transport to the central object
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 Feb 2 transit of the exoplanet XO-3b The new data show that the planetary orbital axis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned as reported earlier by Hebrard and coworkers We find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes to be 37
as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15 deg The significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there are indications of systematic effects XO-3b is the first exoplanet known to have a highly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star and as such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration of massive planets into close-in orbits
We revisit the statistical analysis of spin-orbit alignment in hot-Jupiter systems Assuming the stellar obliquities to be drawn from a single Rayleigh distribution we find the mode of the distribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg However it remains the case that a model representing two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawn from a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropic distribution--is favored over a single Rayleigh distribution
(Abridged) The Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) onboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observed the four large main-belt asteroids (1) Ceres (2) Pallas (4) Vesta and (10) Hygiea multiple times The photometric and spectroscopic data cover the wavelength range between 43 and 197 um and are a unique dataset for future investigations and detailed characterisations of these bodies
The standard ISO archive products produced through the last post-mission LWS pipeline were still affected by instrument artefacts Our goal was to provide the best possible data products to exploit the full scientific potential of these observations We performed a refined reduction of all measurements corrected for various instrumental effects
and re-calibrated the data We outline the data reduction process and give an overview of the available data and the quality of the observations We apply a thermophysical model to the flux measurements to derive far-IR based diameter and albedo values of the asteroids The measured thermal rotational lightcurve of (4) Vesta is compared to model predictions
Three planets have been directly imaged around the young star HR 8799 The planets are 5-13 Mjup and orbit the star at projected separations of 24-68 AU While the initial detection occurred in 2007 two of the planets were recovered in a re-analysis of data obtained in 2004 Here we present a detection of the furthest planet of that system
HR 8799 b in archival HST/NICMOS data from 1998 The detection was made using the locally-optimized combination of images algorithm to construct from a large set of HST/NICMOS images of different stars taken from the archive an optimized reference point-spread function image used to subtract the light of the primary star from the images of HR 8799
This new approach improves the sensitivity to planets at small separations by a factor of ~10 compared to traditional roll deconvolution The new detection provides an astrometry point 10 years before the most recent observations and is consistent with a Keplerian circular orbit with a~70 AU and low orbital inclination
The new photometry point in the F160W filter is in good agreement with an atmosphere model with intermediate clouds and vertical stratification and thus suggests the presence of significant water absorption in the planet&#39;s atmosphere The success of the new approach used here highlights a path for the search and characterization of exoplanets with future space telescopes
The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey specifically the Very Wide segment of data is used to search for possible main-belt comets In the first data set 952 separate objects with asteroidal orbits within the main-belt are examined using a three-level technique First the full-width-half-maximum of each object is compared to stars of similar magnitude
to look for evidence of a coma Second the brightness profiles of each object are compared with three stars of the same magnitude which are nearby on the image to ensure any extended profile is not due to imaging variations Finally the star profiles are subtracted from the asteroid profile and the residuals are compared with the background using an unpaired T-test
No objects in this survey show evidence of cometary activity The second survey includes 11438 objects in the main-belt which are examined visually One object an unknown comet is found to show cometary activity Its motion is consistent with being a main-belt asteroid but the observed arc is too short for a definitive orbit calculation
No other body in this survey shows evidence of cometary activity Upper limits of the number of weakly and strongly active main-belt comets are derived to be 630+/-77 and 87+/-28 respectively These limits are consistent with those expected from asteroid collisions In addition data extracted from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope image archive of main-belt comet 176P/LINEAR is presented
Terrestrial exoplanets are on the verge of joining the ranks of astronomically accessible objects Interpreting their observable characteristics and informing decisions on instrument design and use will hinge on the ability to model these planets successfully across a vast range of configurations and climate forcings A hierarchical approach that addresses fundamental behaviors as well as more complex
The major questions relevant to star and planet formation are What controls the rate efficiency spatial clustering multiplicity and initial mass function of star formation now and in the past? What are the major feedback mechanisms through which star formation affects its environment? What controls the formation and orbital parameters of planets
especially terrestrial planets? These questions cannot be fully addressed without understanding key magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma physics processes Although some of these basic problems have long been considered intractable attacking them through a combination of laboratory experiment theory and numerical simulation is now feasible and would be fruitful Achieving a better understanding of these processes is critical to interpreting observations
Spitzer Space Observatory IRAC and MIPS photometric observations are presented for 20 white dwarfs with T &lt; 20 000 K and metal-contaminated photospheres A warm circumstellar disk is detected at GD 16 and likely at PG 1457-086 while the remaining targets fail to reveal mid-infrared excess typical of dust disks
including a number of heavily polluted stars Extending previous studies over 50% of all single white dwarfs with implied metal accretion rates dM/dt &gt; 3e8 g/s display a warm infrared excess from orbiting dust; the likely result of a tidally-destroyed minor planet This benchmark accretion rate lies between the dust production rates of 1e6 g/s in the solar system zodiacal cloud and 1e10 g/s often inferred for debris disks at main sequence A-type stars
The Cassini cameras have captured the opposition effect in Saturn rings with a high radial resolution at phase angles down to 0 01o in the entire main ring system We derive phase functions from 0 01 to 25 degrees of phase angle in the Wide-Angle Camera clear filters with a central wavelength of 0
We characterize the morphology of the phase functions of different features in the main rings We find that the shape of the phase function is accurately represented by a logarithmic model (Bobrov 1970 in Surfaces and Interiors of Planets and Satellites Academic edited by A Dollfus) For practical purposes we also parametrize the phase curves by a simple linear-by-part model (Lumme and Irvine 1976
Astronomical Journal 81 p865) which provides three morphological parameters the amplitude and the Half-Width at Half-Maximum (HWHM) of the surge and the slope S of the linear-part of the phase function at larger phase angles Our analysis demonstrates that all of these parameters show trends with the optical depth of the rings
These trends imply that the optical depth is a key-element determining the physical properties which act on the opposition effect Wavelength variations of the morphological parameters of the surge show important trends with the optical depth in the green filter (0 568 microns) which implies that grain size effects are maximum in this wavelength
(abridged) Vortices are believed to play a role in the formation of km-sized planetesimals However vortex dynamics is commonly studied in non-self-gravitating discs The main goal here is to examine the effects of disc self-gravity on vortex dynamics For this purpose we employ the 2D self-gravitating shearing sheet approximation A simple cooling law with a constant cooling time is adopted
such that the disc settles down into a quasi-steady gravitoturbulent state In this state vortices appear as transient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation growth to sizes comparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to the combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear Each phase typically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less
As a result in self-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is irregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary stages and therefore with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale Vortices generate density waves during evolution which turn into shocks Therefore the dynamics of density waves and vortices are coupled implying that
in general one should consider both vortex and spiral density wave modes in order to get a proper understanding of self-gravitating disc dynamics Our results suggest that given such an irregular and rapidly varying character of vortex evolution in self-gravitating discs it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively trap dust particles
Using the POLISH instrument I am unable to reproduce the large-amplitude polarimetric observations of Berdyugina et al (2008) to the &gt;99 99% confidence level I observe no significant polarimetric variability in the HD 189733 system and the upper limit to variability from the exoplanet is Delta_P &lt; 7 9 x 10^(-5) with 99% confidence in the 400 nm to 675 nm wavelength range
Berdyugina et al (2008) report polarized scattered light from the atmosphere of the HD 189733b hot Jupiter with an amplitude of two parts in 10^4 Such a large amplitude is over an order of magnitude larger than expected given a geometric albedo similar to other hot Jupiters However my non-detection of polarimetric variability phase-locked to the orbital period of the exoplanet
We study the torque on low mass protoplanets on fixed circular orbits embedded in a protoplanetary disc in the isothermal limit For low mass protoplanets and large viscosity the corotation torque behaves as expected from linear theory However when the viscosity becomes small enough to enable horseshoe turns to occur
the linear corotation torque exists only temporarily after insertion of a planet into the disc being replaced by the horseshoe drag first discussed by Ward This happens after a time that is equal to the horseshoe libration period reduced by a factor amounting to about twice the disc aspect ratio
This torque scales with the radial gradient of specific vorticity as does the linear torque but we find it to be many times larger If the viscosity is large enough for viscous diffusion across the coorbital region to occur within a libration period we find that the horseshoe drag may be sustained
If not the corotation torque saturates leaving only the linear Lindblad torques As the magnitude of the non linear coorbital torque (horseshoe drag) is always found to be larger than the linear torque we find that the sign of the total torque may change even for for mildly positive surface density gradients
Three planets with minimum masses less than 10 Earth masses orbit the star HD 40307 suggesting these planets may be rocky However with only radial velocity data it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or gaseous Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to assess the physical properties of the planets
Observations allow for circular orbits but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at least 0 0001 Also planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects are significant If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0
then going back in time the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of the star (which we estimate to be 6 1 +/- 1 6 Gyr) Moreover if the eccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky then its tidal heating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io
on a per unit surface area basis If planet b is not terrestrial e g Neptune-like these physical constraints would not apply This analysis suggests the planets are not terrestrial-like and are more like our giant planets In either case we find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on (via disk interactions) into their current orbits
OGLE III and MOA II are discovering 600-1000 Galactic Bulge microlens events each year This stretches the resources available for intensive follow-up monitoring of the lightcurves in search of anomalies caused by planets near the lens stars We advocate optimizing microlens planet searches by using an automatic prioritization algorithm based on the planet detection zone area probed by each new data point
This optimization scheme takes account of the telescope and detector characteristics observing overheads sky conditions and the time available for observing on each night The predicted brightness and magnification of each microlens target is estimated by fitting to available data points The optimisation scheme then yields a decision on which targets to observe and which to skip
and a recommended exposure time for each target designed to maximize the planet detection capability of the observations The optimal strategy maximizes detection of planet anomalies and must be coupled with rapid data reduction to trigger continuous follow-up of anomalies that are thereby found A web interface makes the scheme available for use by human or robotic observers at any telescope
Astrometry as a technique has so far proved of limited utility when employed as either a follow-up tool or to independently search for planetary mass companions orbiting nearby stars However this is bound to change during the next decade In this review I start by summarizing past and present efforts to detect planets via milli-arcsecond astrometry
Next I provide an overview of the variety of technical statistical and astrophysical challenges that must be met by future ground-based and space-borne efforts in order to achieve the required degree of astrometric measurement precision Then I discuss the planet-finding capabilities of future astrometric observatories aiming at micro-arcsecond precision with a particular focus on their ability to fully describe multiple-component systems
The aim of this paper is to investigate the conditions for the coexistence of phases in a Lennard Jones fluid The calculation has been performed within the virial developement mathod and as a result a simple approximate relation has been obtained between the number densities of two coexisting densities and the interparticle potentials in them
Each transiting planet discovered is characterized by 7 measurable quantities that may or may not be linked together (planet mass radius orbital period and star mass radius effective temperature and metallicity) Correlations between planet mass and period surface gravity and period planet radius and star temperature have been previously observed among the known transiting giant planets
Two classes of planets have been previously identified based on their Safronov number We use the CoRoTlux code to compare simulated events to the sample of discovered planets and test the statistical significance of these correlations We first generate a stellar field with planetary companions based on radial velocity discoveries and a planetary evolution model
then apply a detection criterion that includes both statistical and red noise sources We compare the yield of our simulated survey with the ensemble of 31 well-characterized giant transiting planets using a multivariate logistic analysis to assess whether the simulated distribution matches the known transiting planets Our multivariate analysis shows that our simulated sample and observations are consistent to 76%
The mass vs period correlation for giant planets first observed with radial velocity holds with transiting planets Our model naturally explains the correlation between planet surface gravity and period and the one between planet radius and stellar effective temperature Finally we are also able to reproduce the previously observed apparent bimodal distribution of Safronov numbers in 10% of our simulated cases
The extrasolar planets (EPs) so far detected are very different to the planets in our own Solar System Many of them have Jupiter-like masses and close-in orbits (the so-called hot planets HPs) with orbital periods of only a few days In this paper we present a new statistical analysis of the observed EPs
focusing on the origin of the HPs Among the several HP formation mechanisms proposed so far the two main formation mechanisms are type II migration and scattering In both cases planets form beyond the so-called snow-line of the protoplanetary disk and then migrate inward due to angular momentum and energy exchange with either the protoplanetary disk or with companion planets
Although theoretical studies produce a range of observed features no firm correspondence between the observed EPs and models has yet been established In our analysis by means of principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis we find convincing indications for the existence of two types of HPs whose parameters reflect physical mechanisms of type II migration and scattering
Through its connection with HED meteorites Vesta is known as one of the first bodies to have accreted and differentiated in the Solar Nebula predating the formation of Jupiter and surviving the violent evolution of the early Solar System The formation time of Ceres instead is unknown but it should not postdate that of Jupiter by far
In this work we modelled the collisional histories of Vesta and Ceres at the time of the formation of Jupiter assumed to be the first giant planet to form In this first investigation of the evolution of the early Solar System we did not include the presence of planetary embryos in the disk of planetesimals but we concentrated on the role of the forming Jupiter and the effects of its possible inward migration due to disk-planet interactions
Our results clearly indicate that the formation of the giant planet caused an intense early bombardment in the orbital region of the Main Asteroid Belt According to our results Vesta and Ceres would not have survived the Jovian early bombardment if the disk was populated mainly by large planetesimals like those predicted to form in turbulent circumstellar disks
Disks dominated by small bodies like those predicted to form in quiescent circumstellar disks or with a varying fraction of the mass in the form of larger (D \geq 100 km) planetesimals represent more favourable environments for the survival of the two asteroids In those scenarios where they survive both asteroids had their surfaces saturated by craters as big as 150 km and a few as big as 200 - 300 km
he triple asteroidal system (87) Sylvia is composed of a 280-km primary and two small moonlets named Romulus and Remus (Marchis et al 2005) Sylvia is located in the main asteroid belt The satellites are in nearly equatorial circular orbits around the primary In the present work we study the stability of the satellites Romulus and Remus
in order to identify the effects and the contribution of each perturber The results from the 3-body problem Sylvia-Romulus-Remus show no significant variation of their orbital elements However the inclinations of the satellites present a long period evolution when the Sun is included in the system Such amplitude is amplified when Jupiter is included
An analysis of these results show that Romulus and Remus are librating in a secular resonance and their longitude of the nodes are locked to each other The satellites get caught in an evection resonance with Jupiter However the orbital evolutions of the satellites became completely stable when the oblateness of Sylvia is included in the simulations
The discovery of the near infrared windows into the Venus deep atmosphere has enabled the use of remote sensing techniques to study the composition of the Venus atmosphere below the clouds In particular water vapor absorption lines can be observed in a number of the near-infrared windows allowing measurement of the H2O abundance at several different levels in the lower atmosphere
Accurate determination of the abundance requires a good database of spectral line parameters for the H2O absorption lines at the high temperatures (up to ~700 K) encountered in the Venus deep atmosphere This paper presents a comparison of a number of H2O line lists that have been or that could potentially be used
to analyze Venus deep atmosphere water abundances and shows that there are substantial discrepancies between them For example the early high-temperature list used by Meadows and Crisp (1996) had large systematic errors in line intensities When these are corrected for using the more recent high-temperature BT2 list of Barber et al
(2006) their value of 45+/-10 ppm for the water vapor mixing ratio reduces to 27+/-6 ppm The HITRAN and GEISA lists used for most other studies of Venus are deficient in &#34;hot&#34; lines that become important in the Venus deep atmosphere and also show evidence of systematic errors in line intensities
particularly for the 8000 to 9500 cm-1 region that includes the 1 18 um window Water vapor mixing ratios derived from these lists may also be somewhat overestimated The BT2 line list is recommended as being the most complete and accurate current representation of the H2O spectrum at Venus temperatures
We present 5 5 to 7 6 micron spectra of comets 71P/Clark (2006 May 27 56 UT r_h = 1 57 AU pre-perihelion) and C/2004 B1 (LINEAR) (2005 October 15 22 UT r_h = 2 21 AU pre-perihelion and 2006 May 16 22 UT r_h = 2 06 AU post-perihelion) obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope
The nu_2 vibrational band of water is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 11 to 50 Fitting the spectra using a fluorescence model of water emission yields a water rotational temperature of &lt; 18 K for 71P/Clark and approximately less than or equivalent to 14 +/- 2 K (pre-perihelion) and 23 +/- 4 K (post-perihelion) for C/2004 B1 (LINEAR)
The water ortho-to-para ratio in C/2004 B1 (LINEAR) is measured to be 2 31 +/- 0 18 which corresponds to a spin temperature of 26^{+3}_{-2} K Water production rates are derived The agreement between the water model and the measurements is good as previously found for Spitzer spectra of C/2003 K4 (LINEAR)
A fundamental question in cometary science is whether the different dynamical classes of comets have different chemical compositions which would reflect different initial conditions From the ground or Earth orbit radio and infrared spectroscopic observations of a now significant sample of comets indeed reveal deep differences in the relative abundances of cometary ices
However no obvious correlation with dynamical classes is found Further results come or are expected from space exploration Such investigations by nature limited to a small number of objects are unfortunately focussed on short-period comets (mainly Jupiter-family) But these in situ studies provide &#34;ground truth&#34; for remote sensing We discuss the chemical differences in comets from our database of spectroscopic radio observations
A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses greater than 0 1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0 5AU to infinity This includes analogs to all the Solar System&#39;s planets except for Mercury as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories
Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes Close-in planets with separations &lt; 0 5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey but these can be found by Kepler Other methods including ground-based microlensing cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide
The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing Thus a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of planetary systems
By analogy with a mechanism proposed by Gold and Soter to explain the retrograde rotation of Venus Arras and Socrates suggest that thermal tides may excite hot jovian exoplanets into nonsynchronous rotation and perhaps also noncircular orbits It is shown here that because of the absence of a solid surface above the convective core of a jovian planet
In a recent paper it was reported a planetary system around the star HD60532 composed by two giant planets in a possible 3 1 mean motion resonance that should be confirmed within the next decade Here we show that the analysis of the global dynamics of the system allows to confirm this resonance
The present best fit to data already corresponds to this resonant configuration and the system is stable for at least 5Gry The 3 1 resonance is so robust that stability is still possible for a wide variety of orbital parameters around the best fit solution and also if the inclination of the system orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky is as small as 15 deg
The paper contains the results of the polarization measurements of twilight sky background during the wintertime including the epoch of Quadrantids activity in January 2008 and 2009 in Crimea (Ukraine) Analysis of the twilight sky polarization behavior had shown the barely detectable depolarization effect at the scattering altitudes above 90 km right after the Quadrantids maximum
We report the discovery of the first low-mass planet to emerge from the NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program a super-Earth orbiting the K0 dwarf HD 7924 Keplerian modeling of precise Doppler radial velocities reveals a planet with minimum mass M_P sin i = 9 26 M_Earth in a P = 5 398 d orbit
Based on Keck-HIRES measurements from 2001 to 2008 the planet is robustly detected with an estimated false alarm probability of less than 0 001 Photometric observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory show that HD 7924 is photometrically constant over the radial velocity period to 0 19 mmag
supporting the existence of the planetary companion No transits were detected down to a photometric limit of ~0 5 mmag eliminating transiting planets with a variety of compositions HD 7924b is one of only eight planets known with M_P sin i &lt; 10 M_Earth and as such is a member of an emerging family of low-mass planets that together constrain theories of planet formation
I argue for two modes of gas giant planet formation and discuss the conditions under which each mode operates Gas giant planets at disk radii $r&gt;100$ AU are likely to form in situ by disk instability while core accretion plus gas capture remains the dominant formation mechanism for $r&lt;100$ AU
During the mass accretion phase mass loading can push disks toward fragmentation conditions at large $r$ Massive extended disks can fragment into clumps of a few to tens of Jupiter masses This is confirmed by radiation hydrodynamics simulations The two modes of gas giant formation should lead to a bimodal distribution of gas giant semi-major axes
We aim to demonstrate the efficiency of a Bayesian approach in analysing radial velocity data by reanalysing a set of radial velocity measurements We present Bayesian analysis of a recently published set of radial velocity measurements known to contain the signal of one extrasolar planetary candidate namely HD 11506 The analysis is conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and the resulting distributions of orbital parameters are tested by performing direct integration of randomly selected samples with the Bulirsch-Stoer method
The magnitude of the stellar radial velocity variability known as jitter is treated as a free parameter with no assumptions about its magnitude We show that the orbital parameters of the planet known to be present in the data correspond to a different solution when the jitter is allowed to be a free parameter
Recent observations show that planet can reside in close binary systems with stellar separation of only about 20 AU However planet formation in such close binary systems is a challenge to current theory One of the major theoretical problems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into planetary embryos-during which the companion&#39;s perturbations can stir up the relative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their growth
However all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a coplanar binary orbit Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk and an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0 1-5 deg we numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU an extension of the habitable zone(1-1
around alpha Centauri A in this paper Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to (1) differential orbital phasing is realized in the 3D space and thus different-sized bodies are separated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower and impacts mainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored
but the balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain and the &#34;possible accretion region&#34; extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical specific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact velocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their escape velocities which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II runaway mode
We report the detection of a transit egress by the ~ 3 9-Jupiter-mass planet HD 80606b an object in a highly-eccentric orbit (e ~ 0 93) about its parent star of approximately solar type The astrophysical reality of the signal of variability in HD 80606 is confirmed by observation with two independent telescope systems
and checks against several reference stars in the field Differential photometry with respect to the nearby comparison star HD 80607 provides a precise light curve Modelling of the light curve with a full eccentric-orbit model indicates a planet/star-radius ratio of 0 1057 +/- 0 0018 corresponding to a planet radius of 1
giving a total transit duration of 12 1 +/- 0 4 hours The planet hence joins HD 17156b in a class of highly eccentric transiting planets in which HD 80606b has both the longest period and most eccentric orbit The recently reported discovery of a secondary eclipse of HD 80606b by the Spitzer Space Observatory permits a combined analysis with the mid-time of primary transit in which the orbital parameters of the system can be tightly constrained
The time dependence of the changes in the emission spectra of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 after Deep Impact are derived and discussed This was a unique event because for the first time it gave astronomers the opportunity to follow the time history of the formation and decay of O(1S) OH CN
C2 C3 NH and NH2 Least squares fits of a modified Haser model with constraints using known rate constants were fit to the observed data In the case of OH a simple two-step Haser model provides a reasonable fit to the observations Fitting the emissions from O(1S) CN C2 C3
NH and NH2 requires the addition of a delayed component to a regular two or three step Haser model From this information a picture of the Deep Impact encounter emerges where there is an initial formation of gas and dust which is responsible for the prompt emission that occurs right after impact
A secondary source of gas starts later after impact when the initial dust has dissipated enough so that solar radiation can reach the surface of freshly exposed material The implications of this and other results are discussed in terms of the implications on the structure and composition of the comet&#39;s nucleus
Gravitational microlensing provides a unique window on the properties and prevalence of extrasolar planetary systems because of its ability to find low-mass planets at separations of a few AU The early evidence from microlensing indicates that the most common type of exoplanet yet detected are the so-called &#34;super-Earth&#34; planets of ~10 Earth-masses at a separation of a few AU from their host stars
The detection of two such planets indicates that roughly one third of stars have such planets in the separation range 1 5-4 AU which is about an order of magnitude larger than the prevalence of gas-giant planets at these separations We review the basic physics of the microlensing method and show why this method allows the detection of Earth-mass planets at separations of 2-3 AU with ground-based observations
We explore the conditions that allow the detection of the planetary host stars and allow measurement of planetary orbital parameters Finally we show that a low-cost space-based microlensing survey can provide a comprehensive statistical census of extrasolar planetary systems with sensitivity down to 0 1 Earth-masses at separations ranging from 0
The areal centroids of the youngest polar deposits on Mars are offset from those of adjacent paleopolar deposits by 5-10 degrees We test the hypothesis that the offset is the result of true polar wander (TPW) the motion of the solid surface with respect to the spin axis caused by a mass redistribution within or on the surface of Mars
In particular we consider TPW driven by late-stage volcanism during the late Hesperian to Amazonian There is observational and qualitative support for this hypothesis in both North and South observed offsets lie close to a great circle 90 degrees from Tharsis as expected for polar wander after Tharsis formed We calculate the magnitude and direction of TPW produced by mapped late-stage lavas for a range of lithospheric thicknesses
lava thicknesses eruption histories and prior polar wander events If Tharsis formed close to the equator the stabilizing effect of a fossil rotational bulge located close to the equator leads to predicted TPW of &lt;2 degrees too small to account for observed offsets If however Tharsis formed far from the equator
late-stage TPW driven by low-latitude late-stage volcanism would be 6-33 degrees similar to that inferred from the location of paleopolar deposits 4 4+/-1 3x10^19 kg of young erupted lava can account for the offset of the Dorsa Argentea Formation from the present-day south rotation pole This mass is consistent with prior mapping-based estimates and would imply a mass release of CO2 by volcanic degassing similar to that in the atmosphere at the present time
The orbital evolution of particles released from the surface of a rubble-pile body by Earth&#39;s tides during flyby within the Roche limit is studied Test particles initially placed on the surface leave the surface and escape the parent body Released particles remain in a relative small cloud for about 500 years and spread evenly along the orbit of the parent asteroid during next several hundred years
The geo and solar magnetic fields have long been thought to be very different objects both in terms of spatial structure and temporal behavior The recently discovered field structure of a fully convective star is more reminiscent of planetary magnetic fields than the Sun&#39;s magnetic field (Donati J -F et al
Science 311 (2006) 633) despite the fact that the physical and chemical properties of these objects clearly differ This observation suggests that a simple controlling parameter could be responsible for these different behaviors We report here the results of three-dimensional simulations which show that varying the aspect ratio of the active dynamo region can yield sharp transition from Earth-like steady dynamos to Sun-like dynamo waves
We investigate the effects of viscosity on disk-planet interaction and discuss how type I migration of planets is modified We have performed a linear calculation using shearing-sheet approximation and obtained the detailed high resolution density structure around the planet embedded in a viscous disk with a wide range of viscous coefficients
We use a time-dependent formalism that is useful in investigating the effects of various physical processes on disk-planet interaction We find that the density structure in the vicinity of the planet is modified and the main contribution to the torque comes from this region in contrast to inviscid case Although it is not possible to derive total torque acting on the planet within the shearing-sheet approximation
the one-sided torque can be very different from the inviscid case depending on the Reynolds number This effect has been neglected so far but our results indicate that the interaction between a viscous disk and a planet can be qualitatively different from an inviscid case and the details of the density structure in the vicinity of the planet is critically important
The evidence is mounting that star formation necessarily involves planet formation We clearly have a vested interest in finding other Earths but a true understanding of planet formation requires completing the census and mapping planetary architecture in all its grandeur and diversity Here we show that a 2000-star survey undertaken with SIM Lite will uniquely probe planets around B-A-F stars
In laboratory experiments we determine the mass gain and loss in central collisions between cm to dm-size SiO2 dust targets and sub-mm to cm-size SiO2 dust projectiles of varying mass size shape and at different collision velocities up to ~56 5 m/s Dust projectiles much larger than 1 mm lead to a small amount of erosion of the target but decimetre targets do not break up
Collisions produce ejecta which are smaller than the incoming projectile Projectiles smaller than 1 mm are accreted by a target even at the highest collision velocities This implies that net accretion of decimetre and larger bodies is possible Independent of the original size of a projectile considered after several collisions all fragments will be of sub-mm size which might then be (re)-accreted in the next collision with a larger body
The detection of lower mass planets now being reported via radial velocity and microlensing surveys suggests that they may be ubiquitous If missions such as Kepler are able to confirm this the detection and study of rocky planets via direct imaging with ground-based telescopes of apertures &gt; 20 m is feasible in the thermal infrared
We discuss two cases for detecting rocky planets the first via detection of molten Earths formed though an Earth-Moon like impact event and the second via detection of planets around very nearby stars These observations have the potential to give us a first look at a rocky planet similar to the Earth
The Centaurs are recent escapees from the Kuiper belt that are destined either to meet fiery oblivion in the hot inner regions of the Solar system or to be ejected to the interstellar medium by gravitational scattering from the giant planets Dynamically evolved Centaurs when captured by Jupiter and close enough to the Sun for near-surface water ice to sublimate
are conventionally labeled as &#34;short-period&#34; (specifically Jupiter-family) comets Remarkably some Centaurs show comet-like activity even when far beyond the orbit of Jupiter suggesting mass-loss driven by a process other than the sublimation of water ice We observed a sample of 23 Centaurs and found nine to be active with mass-loss rates measured from several kg/s to several tonnes/s
Considered as a group we find that the &#34;active Centaurs&#34; in our sample have perihelia smaller than the inactive Centaurs (median 5 9 AU vs 8 7 AU) and smaller than the median perihelion distance computed for all known Centaurs (12 4 AU) This suggests that their activity is thermally driven
There are several possibilities for the origin of the mass-loss from the active Centaurs We consider the possibility that activity in the Centaurs is triggered by the conversion of amorphous ice into the crystalline form accompanied by the release of trapped gases including carbon monoxide By imposing the condition that crystallization should occur when the crystallization time is shorter than the orbital period we find a qualitative match to the perihelion distribution of the active Centaurs and conclude that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Centaurs contain amorphous ice
Of the approximately 350 extrasolar planets currently known of order 10% orbit evolved stars with radii R &gt;~ 2 5 R_sun These planets are of particular interest because they tend to orbit more massive hosts and have been subjected to variable stellar insolation over their recent histories as their primaries evolved off the main sequence
Unfortunately we have limited information about the physical properties of these planets as they were all detected by the radial velocity method and none have been observed to transit Here we evaluate the prospects for detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars We show that several of the known systems have a priori transit probabilities of &gt;~ 10%
and about one transiting system is expected for the sample of host stars with R &gt;= 2 5 R_sun Although the transits are expected to have very small amplitudes (~few x 10^-4) and long durations (&gt;~ 50 hrs) we argue that the difficulty with detecting these signals in broadband light is one of systematic errors and practicality rather than photon noise
even for modest aperture ~1m telescopes We propose a novel method that may overcome these difficulties which uses narrow-band measurements to isolate the thin ring of chromospheric emission expected at the limb of giant stars The transit signals in these narrow bands are expected to be larger in magnitude and briefer in duration than in broad-band emission
Precision Doppler measurements from an intensive 48 night &#34;Rocky Planet Search&#34; observing campaign on the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) have revealed the presence of a low-mass exoplanet orbiting the G1 dwarf HD16417 Subsequent Doppler observations with the AAT as well as independent observations obtained by the Keck Planet Search have confirmed this initial detection and refine the orbital parameters to period 17
eccentricity 0 20+/-0 09 orbital semi-major axis 0 14+/-0 01 AU and minimum planet mass 22 1+/-2 0 Mearth HD 16417 raises the number of published exoplanets with minimum masses of less than 25 Mearth to eighteen Interestingly the distribution of detected sub-25 Mearth planets over the spectral types G
K and M is almost uniform The detection of HD 16417b by an intensive observing campaign clearly demonstrates the need for extended and contiguous observing campaigns when aiming to detect low-amplitude Doppler planets in short period orbits Perhaps most critically it demonstrates that the search for low-mass Doppler planets will eventually require these traditional &#34;bright-time&#34; projects to extend throughout dark lunations
Searches for planets around massive stars are essential for developing general understanding of planet formation and evolution of the planetary systems The main objective of the Pennsylvania - Torun Planet Search is detection of planets around G-K subgiants and giants through precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with iodine absorption cell using HET HRS spectrograph
However the long period radial velocity variations of red giants may also have other than planetary nature (e g a non-radial pulsations or rotational modulation in presence of starspots) In this work we present bisector analysis of cross-correlation functions (CCF) constructed from the spectra used for radial velocity determination but cleaned from the iodine lines for the second red giant with planets from our survey HD 102272
A simulation of de-biased population of NEAs is presented The numerical integration of modeled orbits reveals geometrical conditions of close approaching NEAs to the Earth The population with the absolute magnitude up to H=28 is simulated during one year The probability of possible discoveries of the objects in the Earth vicinity is discussed
As the SALT High Resolution Spectrograph completion is nearing we plan to extend the Pennsylvania-Torun Planets Search (PTPS) with HET to the southern hemisphere Due to overlap of the skies available for both HET and SALT in the declination range (+10 -10) deg some cooperation and immediate follow up is possible
Tidal friction is thought to be important in determining the long-term spin-orbit evolution of short-period extrasolar planetary systems Using a simple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction Eggleton Kiseleva &amp; Hut (1998) we analyse the effects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking on the evolution of such systems
A phase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations including only the stellar tide together with a model of the braking torque proposed by Verbunt &amp; Zwaan (1981) is presented The inclusion of stellar magnetic braking is found to be extremely important in determining the secular evolution of such systems
and its neglect results in a very different orbital history We then show the results of numerical integrations of the full tidal evolution equations using the misaligned spin and orbit of the XO-3 system as an example to study the accuracy of simple timescale estimates of tidal evolution We find that it is essential to consider coupled evolution of the orbit and the stellar spin in order to model the behaviour accurately
In addition we find that for typical Hot Jupiters the stellar spin-orbit alignment timescale is of the same order as the inspiral time which tells us that if a planet is observed to be aligned then it probably formed coplanar This reinforces the importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree of spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems
We present a study of the newly-discovered main-belt comet P/2008 R1 (Garradd) an object with the dynamical characteristics of an asteroid and the physical characteristics of a comet Photometry sets a limit to the effective radius of the nucleus at r_e &lt; 0 7 km (red geometric albedo 0 05 assumed)
The coma shows a secular fading in our data caused by the escape of dust particles from the near-nucleus environment The optical reflection spectrum is a nearly neutral continuum devoid of gaseous emission lines from which we derive a limit to the cyanide (CN) radical production rate of Q_CN &lt;1
Unlike the first-reported main-belt comets P/2008 R1 is not dynamically stable The nearby 8 3 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter induces dynamical instability on timescales 20 to 30 Myr Hence we conclude that P/2008 R1 has recently arrived from a more stable source elsewhere The high Tisserand parameter of the orbit (in fact
with T_J = 3 216 it is the highest of any comet) points to a source in the asteroid belt itself instead of in the Kuiper belt (putative source of the Jupiter family comets) We infer that P/2008 R1 is an icy body from the outer asteroid belt in which sublimation has been triggered by rising temperatures resulting from a decreasing perihelion distance
In the last years the Space Science community was confronted to a continuous increasing interest in Martian missions extra-solar planet search and multi-satellite missions The presented T I P O mission is a proposal for a research program dedicated to study by space borne interferometric methods the radio emissions generated in the atmospheres and magnetospheres of planets
Tidal friction is thought to be important in determining the long-term spin-orbit evolution of short-period extrasolar planetary systems Using a simple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction we study the evolution of close-in planets on inclined orbits due to tides We analyse the effects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking by performing a phase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations
including the braking torque The inclusion of magnetic braking is found to be important and its neglect can result in a very different system history We then present the results of numerical integrations of the tidal evolution equations where we find that it is essential to consider coupled evolution of the orbital and rotational elements
including dissipation in both the star and planet to accurately model the evolution The main result of our integrations is that for typical Hot Jupiters tidal friction aligns the stellar spin with the orbit on a similar time as it causes the orbit to decay This means that if a planet is observed to be aligned
then it probably formed coplanar This reinforces the importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree of spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems We apply these results to the XO-3 system and constrain the tidal quality factors Q&#39; in both the star and planet in this system Using a model in which inertial waves are excited by tidal forcing in the outer convective envelope and dissipated by turbulent viscosity
we calculate Q&#39; for a range of F-star models and find it to vary considerably within this class of stars This means that assuming a single Q&#39; applies to all stars is probably incorrect We propose an explanation for the survival of WASP-12 b &amp; OGLE-TR-56 b in terms of weak dissipation in the star
We carried out observations with five different instruments ranging in aperture from 0 4m to 10m of the satellites of Uranus during that planet&#39;s 2007 Equinox Our observations covered specific intervals of time when mutual eclipses and occultations were predicted <br>The observations were carried out in the near-infrared part of the spectrum to mitigate the glare from the planet
Frames were acquired at rates &gt; 1/min Following modelling and subtraction of the planetary source from these frames differential aperture photometry was carried out on the satellite pairs involved in the predicted events In all cases but one nearby bright satellites were used as reference sources <br>We have obtained fifteen individual lightcurves
eight of which show a clear drop in the flux from the satellite pair indicating that a mutual event took place Three of these involve the faint satellite Miranda All eight lightcurves were model-fitted to yield best estimates of the time of maximum flux drop and the impact parameter In three cases best-fit albedo ratios were also derived
We used these estimates to generate intersatellite astrometric positions with typical formal uncertainties of &lt;0 01 arcsec several times better than conventional astrometry of these satellites The statistics of our estimated event midtimes show a systematic lag with the observations later than predictions In addition lightcurves of two partial eclipses of Miranda show no statistically significant evidence of a light drop
We perform numerical simulations to study the secular orbital evolution and dynamical structure in the quintuplet planetary system 55 Cancri with the self-consistent orbital solutions by Fischer and coworkers (2008) In the simulations we show that this system can be stable at least for $10^{8}$ yr In addition we extensively investigate the planetary configuration of four outer companions with one terrestrial planet in the wide region of 0
We show that there are unstable regions for the orbits about 4 1 3 1 and 5 2 mean motion resonances (MMRs) with the outermost planet in the system and several stable orbits can remain at 3 2 and 1 1 MMRs which is resemblance to the asteroidal belt in solar system
A novel method of generating artificial scintillation noise is developed and used to evaluate occultation rates and false positive rates for surveys probing the Kuiper Belt with the method of serendipitous stellar occultations A thorough examination of survey design shows that (1) diffraction-dominated occultations are critically (Nyquist) sampled at a rate of 2 Fsu^{-1}
corresponding to 40 s^{-1} for objects at 40 AU (2) occultation detection rates are maximized when targets are observed at solar opposition (3) Main Belt Asteroids will produce occultations lightcurves identical to those of Kuiper Belt Objects if target stars are observed at solar elongations of 116 deg &lt; epsilon &lt; 125 deg
Existing and planned radiotelescopes working in the millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre wavelengths range provide the possibility to be used for atmospheric line observations To scrutinize this potential we outline the differences and similarities in technical equipment and observing techniques between ground-based aeronomy mm-wave radiometers and radiotelescopes Comprehensive tables summarizing the technical characteristics of existing and future (sub)-mm radiotelescopes are given
The advantages and disadvantages using radiotelescopes for atmospheric line observations are discussed In view of the importance of exploring the sub-mm and far-infrared wavelengths range for astronomical observations and atmospheric sciences we present model calculations of the atmospheric transmission for selected telescope sites (DOME-C/Antarctica ALMA/Chajnantor JCMT and CSO on Mauna Kea/Hawaii
KOSMA/Swiss Alpes) for frequencies between 0 and 2000 GHz (150 micron) and typical atmospheric conditions using the forward model MOLIERE (version~5) For the DOME-C site the transmission over a larger range of up to 10 THz (30 micron) is calculated in order to demonstrate the quality of an earth-bound site for mid-IR observations
A mass-radius relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets It relies on the assumption that solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates around which a variable amount of water is added The M-R law has been set up assuming that the planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets
Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available the composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained Similarly thermal profiles are poorly known In this work the effect of compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and temperature are of second order compared to the effect of the water amount
The Super-Earths family includes four classes of planets iron-rich silicate-rich water-rich or with a thick atmosphere For a given mass the planetary radius increases significantly from the ironrich to the atmospheric-rich planet Even if some overlaps are likely M-R measurements could be accurate enough to ascertain the discovery of an earth-like planet
The present work describes how the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements Such an estimate depends on several assumptions including i) the accuracy of the internal structure model and ii) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements It is shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known
We present the determination of the geometric R-band albedos of two main-belt comet nuclei based on data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and a number of ground-based optical facilities For 133P/Elst-Pizarro we find an albedo of p_R=0 05+/-0 02 and an effective radius of r_e=1 9+/-0 3 km (estimated semi-axes of a~2
For 176P/LINEAR we find an albedo of p_R=0 06+/-0 02 and an effective radius of r_e=2 0+/-0 2 km (estimated semi-axes of a~2 6 km and b~1 5 km) In terms of albedo 133P and 176P are similar to each other and are typical of other Themis family asteroids C-class asteroids
and other comet nuclei We find no indication that 133P and 176P are compositionally unique among other dynamically-similar (but inactive) members of the Themis family in agreement with previous assertions that the two objects most likely formed in-situ We also note that low albedo (p_R&lt;0 075) remains a consistent feature of all cometary (i
We report on the results of a six-month photometric study of the main-belt binary C-type asteroid 121 Hermione performed during its 2007 opposition We took advantage of the rare observational opportunity afforded by one of the annual equinoxes of Hermione occurring close to its opposition in June 2007 The equinox provides an edge-on aspect for an Earth-based observer
which is well suited to a thorough study of Hermione&#39;s physical characteristics The catalog of observations carried out with small telescopes is presented in this work together with new adaptive optics (AO) imaging obtained between 2005 and 2008 with the Yepun 8-m VLT telescope and the 10-m Keck telescope The most striking result is confirmation that Hermione is a bifurcated and elongated body
as suggested by Marchis et al (2005) A new effective diameter of 187 +/- 6 km was calculated from the combination of AO photometric and thermal observations The new diameter is some 10% smaller than the hitherto accepted radiometric diameter based on IRAS data The reason for the discrepancy is that IRAS viewed the system almost pole-on
New thermal observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope agree with the diameter derived from AO and lightcurve observations On the basis of the new AO astrometric observations of the small 32-km diameter satellite we have refined the orbit solution and derived a new value of the bulk density of Hermione of 1
We have used the STACEE high-energy gamma-ray detector to look for fast blue-green laser pulses from the vicinity of 187 stars The STACEE detector offers unprecedented light-collecting capability for the detection of nanosecond pulses from such lasers We estimate STACEE&#39;s sensitivity to be approximately 10 photons per square meter at a wavelength of 420 nm
Here we describe the observations and the resulting constraints on the upper atmosphere (thermosphere and exosphere) of the &#34;Hot-Jupiters&#34; In particular observations and theoretical modeling of Hot-Jupiter evaporation are described The observations allowed the discovery that the planet orbiting HD209458 has an extended atmosphere of escaping hydrogen and showed the presence of oxygen and carbon at very high altitude
These observations give unique constraints on the escape rate and mechanism in the atmosphere of these planets The most recent Lyman-alpha HST observations of HD189733b allows for the first time to compare the evaporation from two different planets in different environments Models to quantify the escape rate from the measured occultation depths
Using numerical simulation Holmstrom et al (2008) proposed a plausible alternative explanation of the observed Lyman-alpha absorption that was seen during the transit of HD 209458b (Vidal-Madjar et al 2003) They conclude that radiation pressure alone cannot explain the observations and that a peculiar stellar wind is needed Here we show that radiation pressure alone can in fact produce the observed high-velocity hydrogen atoms
We also emphasize that even if the stellar wind is responsible for the observed hydrogen to have a sufficient number of atoms for charge exchange with stellar wind the energetic neutral atom (ENA) model also needs a significant escape from the planet atmosphere of similar amplitude as quoted in Vidal-Madjar et al
We present a compilation of the planet candidates currently known from direct imaging We have gathered available data from the literature and derive the luminosity of all candidates in a homogeneous way using a bolometric correction the distances and the K band magnitudes of the objects In a final step we find the masses of the candidates from a comparison of the luminosity or
Recent developments of dynamic x-ray characterization experiments of dense matter are reviewed with particular emphasis on conditions relevant to interiors of terrestrial and gas giant planets These studies include characterization of compressed states of matter in light elements by x-ray scattering and imaging of shocked iron by radiography Several applications of this work are examined
In this work we report on microgravity studies of particle ensembles simulating ice-particle collisions in Saturn&#39;s dense main rings We have developed an experimental method to study the energy dissipation in a many-body system consisting of approx one hundred cm-sized glass spheres The temporal development of the mean particle velocity
ranging from ~10 cm/s (at the beginning) to ~0 35 cm/s (after 9s of experiment duration) can be explained by a constant coefficient of restitution of 0 64 A comparison to values obtained for pure water-ice bodies shows that future cryogenic ice-collision experiments can achieve collision velocities of ~0 1 cm/s
Context Secondary eclipse measurements of transiting extrasolar planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have yielded several direct detections of thermal exoplanet light Since Spitzer operates at wavelengths longward of 3 6 um arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3 um) is inaccessible with this satellite
This region is at the peak of the planet&#39;s spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission <br>Aims So far 2 2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements which are possible from the ground have not yet lead to secure detections
The aim of this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b in K-band and in addition to observe its transit to obtain an accurate planet radius in the near infrared <br>Methods We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the secondary eclipse
and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe the transit of TrES-3b Both observations involved significant defocusing of the telescope aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand frames at high efficiency with the starlight spread out over many pixels <br>Results We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of -0
This corresponds to a day-side brightness temperature of T_B(2 2um)= 2040+-185 K which is consistent with current models of the physical properties of this planet&#39;s upper atmosphere The centre of the eclipse seems slightly offset from phase phi=0 5 by Delta_phi=-0 0042+-0 0027 which could indicate that the orbit of TrES-3b is non-circular [abridged]
We present a combined analysis of previously published high-precision radial velocities and astrometry for the GJ876 planetary system using a self-consistent model that accounts for the planet-planet interactions Assuming the three planets so far identified in the system are coplanar we find that including the astrometry in the analysis does not result in a best-fit inclination significantly different than that found by Rivera and collaborators from analyzing the radial velocities alone
In this unique case the planet-planet interactions are of such significance that the radial velocity data set is more sensitive to the inclination of the system through the dependence of the interactions on the true masses of the two gas giant planets in the system (planets b and c) The astrometry does allow determination of the absolute orbital inclination (i
e distinguishing between i and 180-i) and longitude of the ascending node for planet b which allows us to quantify the mutual inclination angle between its orbit and planet c&#39;s orbit when combined with the dynamical considerations We find that the planets have a mutual inclination of 5 0 +3
This result constitutes the first determination of the degree of coplanarity in an exoplanetary system around a normal star That we find the two planets&#39; orbits are nearly coplanar like the orbits of the Solar System planets indicates that the planets likely formed in a circumstellar disk and that their subsequent dynamical evolution into a 2
The far-IR spectral window plays host to a wide range of both spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics with which to open the protoplanetary disks and exoplanet research to wavelengths completely blocked by the Earth&#39;s atmosphere These include some of the key atomic (e g oxygen) and molecular (e g water) cooling lines
the dust thermal emission the water ice features as well as many other key chemical tracers Most of these features can not be observed from ground-based telescopes but play a critical diagnostic in a number of key areas including the early stages of planet formation and potentially exoplanets The proposed Japanese-led IR space telescope SPICA
with its 3 5m cooled mirror will be the next step in sensitivity after Herschel SPICA has been recently selected to go to the next stage of the ESA&#39;s Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 process This contribution summarizes the design concept behind SAFARI an imaging far-IR spectrometer covering the ~30-210um waveband that is one of a suite of instruments for SPICA; it also highlights some of the science questions that it will be possible to address in the field of exoplanets and planet formation
We present the results of a wide-field survey for distant Sedna-like bodies in the outer solar system using the 1 2-m Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory We searched ~12 000 square degrees down to a mean limiting magnitude of 21 3 in R A total number of 53 Kuiper belt objects and Centaurs have been detected; 25 of which were discovered in this survey
In this paper we characterize the morphology of the disk-integrated phase functions of satellites and rings around the giant planets of our Solar System We find that the shape of the phase function is accurately represented by a logarithmic model (Bobrov 1970 in Surfaces and Interiors of Planets and Satellites
Academic edited by A Dollfus) For practical purposes we also parametrize the phase curves by a linear-exponential model (Kaasalainen et al 2001 Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer 70 529-543) and a simple linear-by-parts model (Lumme and Irvine 1976 Astronomical Journal 81 865-893) which provides three morphological parameters the amplitude A and the Half-Width at Half-Maximum (HWHM) of the opposition surge
and the slope S of the linear part of the phase function at larger phase angles Our analysis demonstrates that all of these morphological parameters are correlated with the single scattering albedos of the surfaces By taking more accurately into consideration the finite angular size of the Sun we find that the Galilean
Saturnian Uranian and Neptunian satellites have similar HWHMs (0 5 degrees) whereas they have a wide range of amplitudes A The Moon has the largest HWHM (2 degrees) We interpret that as a consequence of the solar size bias via the finite size of the Sun which varies dramatically from the Earth to Neptune
By applying a new method that attempts to morphologically deconvolve the phase function to the solar angular size we find that icy and young surfaces with active resurfacing have the smallest values of A and HWHM whereas dark objects (and perhaps older surfaces) such as the Moon Nereid and Saturn C ring have the largest A and HWHM
The aim of the Degenerate Objects around Degenerate Objects (DODO) survey is to search for very low mass brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets in wide orbits around white dwarfs via direct imaging The direct detection of such companions would allow the spectroscopic investigation of objects with temperatures much lower (&lt; 500 K) than the coolest brown dwarfs currently observed
These ultra-low mass substellar objects would have spectral types &gt; T8 5 and so could belong to the proposed Y dwarf spectral sequence The detection of a planet around a white dwarf would prove that such objects can survive the final stages of stellar evolution and place constraints on the frequency of planetary systems around their progenitors (with masses between 1
i e early B to mid F) This paper presents the results of a multi-epoch J band common proper motion survey of 23 nearby equatorial and northern hemisphere white dwarfs We rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions with limiting masses determined from the completeness limit of each observation
to 18 white dwarfs For the remaining five targets the motion of the white dwarf is not sufficiently separated from the non-moving background objects in each field These targets require additional observations to conclusively rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions From our completeness limits we tentatively suggest that &lt; 5% of white dwarfs have substellar companions with effective temperatures &gt; 500 K between projected physical separations of 60 - 200 AU
The transiting exoplanet HD 149026b is an important case for theories of planet formation and planetary structure because the planet&#39;s relatively small size has been interpreted as evidence for a highly metal-enriched composition We present observations of 4 transits with the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on the Hubble Space Telescope
within a wavelength range of 1 1--2 0 $\mu$m Analysis of the light curve gives the most precise estimate yet of the stellar mean density $\rho_\star = 0 497^{+0 042}_{-0 057}$ g cm$^{-3}$ By requiring agreement between the observed stellar properties (including $\rho_\star$) and stellar evolutionary models we refine the estimate of the stellar radius
$R_\star = 1 541^{+0 046}_{-0 042}$ $R_\sun$ We also find a deeper transit than has been measured at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths Taken together these findings imply a planetary radius of $R_p = 0 813^{+0 027}_{-0 025}$ $R_{\rm Jup}$ which is larger than earlier estimates Models of the planetary interior still require a metal-enriched composition
although the required degree of metal enrichment is reduced It is also possible that the deeper NICMOS transit is caused by wavelength-dependent absorption by constituents in the planet&#39;s atmosphere although simple model atmospheres do not predict this effect to be strong enough to account for the discrepancy We use the 4 newly-measured transit times to compute a refined transit ephemeris
We study the coorbital flow for embedded low mass planets We provide a simple semi-analytic model for the corotation region which is subsequently compared to high resolution numerical simulations The model is used to derive an expression for the half-width of the horseshoe region x_s which in the limit of zero softening is given by x_s/r_p = 1
where q is the planet to central star mass ratio h is the disc aspect ratio and r_p the orbital radius This is in very good agreement with the same quantity measured from simulations This result is used to show that horseshoe drag is about an order of magnitude larger than the linear corotation torque in the zero softening limit
Thus the horseshoe drag the sign of which depends on the gradient of specific vorticity is important for estimates of the total torque acting on the planet We further show that phenomena such as the Lindblad wakes with a radial separation from corotation of ~ a pressure scale height H can affect x_s
Mutual sticking of dust aggregates is the first step toward planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks In spite that the electric charging of dust particles is well recognized in some contexts it has been largely ignored in the current modeling of dust coagulation In this study we present a general analysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks
and then demonstrate how the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted scenario of dust coagulation First we describe a new semianalytical method to calculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently This method is far more efficient than previous numerical methods and provides a general and clear description of the charge state of gas-dust mixture
Second we apply this analysis to early evolutionary stages where the dust has been thought to grow into fractal ($D \sim 2$) aggregates with a quasi-monodisperse (i e narrow) size distribution We find that for a wide range of model parameters the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the electric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually &#34;freezes out&#34; on its way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression
Strong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth barrier but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in later growth stages These facts suggest that the combination of electric repulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on dust growth in protoplanetary disks We propose a possible scenario of dust evolution after the freeze-out
A Bayesian re-analysis of published radial velocity data sets is providing evidence for additional planetary candidates The nonlinear model fitting is accomplished with a new hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which incorporates parallel tempering simulated annealing and genetic crossover operations Each of these features facilitate the detection of a global minimum in chi^2
By combining all three the HMCMC greatly increases the probability of realizing this goal When applied to the Kepler problem it acts as a powerful multi-planet Kepler periodogram for both parameter estimation and model selection The HMCMC algorithm is embedded in a unique two stage adaptive control system that automates the tuning of the MCMC proposal distributions through an annealing operation
The aim of the present work is to study the potential short-term atmospheric and biospheric influence of Gamma Ray Bursts on the Earth We focus in the ultraviolet flash at the planet&#39;s surface which occurs as a result of the retransmission of the $\gamma$ radiation through the atmosphere This would be the only important short-term effect on life
We mostly consider Archean and Proterozoic eons and for completeness we also comment on the Phanerozoic Therefore in our study we consider atmospheres with oxygen levels ranging from $10^{-5}$ to 1% of the present atmospheric level representing different moments in the oxygen rise history Ecological consequences and some strategies to estimate their importance are outlined
We present a model for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by winds from either the central star or the inner disk These winds obliquely strike the flaring disk surface and strip away disk material by entraining it in an outward radial-moving flow at the wind-disk interface which lies several disk scale heights above the mid-plane
The disk dispersal time depends on the entrainment velocity at which disk material flows into this turbulent shear layer interface If the entrainment efficiency is ~10% of the local sound speed a likely upper limit the dispersal time at 1 AU is ~6 Myr for a disk with a surface density of 10^3 g cm^{-2}
a solar mass central star and a wind with an outflow rate 10^{-8} Msun/yr and terminal velocity 200 km/s When compared to photoevaporation and viscous evolution wind stripping can be a dominant mechanism only for the combination of low accretion rates (&lt; 10^{-8} Msun/yr) and wind outflow rates approaching these accretion rates
In our previous paper we evaluated the transit duration variation (TDV) effect for a co-aligned planet-moon system at an orbital inclination of i=90 degrees Here we will consider the effect for the more general case of i &lt;= 90 degrees and an exomoon inclined from the planet-star plane by Euler rotation angles $\alpha$
$\beta$ and $\gamma$ We find that the TDV signal has two major components one due to the velocity variation effect described in our first paper and one new component due to transit impact parameter variation By evaluating the dominant terms we find the two effects are additive for prograde exomoon orbits
and deductive for retrograde orbits This asymmetry could allow for future determination of the orbital sense of motion We re-evaluate the ratio of TDV and TTV effects $\eta$ in the more general case of an inclined planetary orbit with a circular orbiting moon and find that it is still possible to directly determine the moon&#39;s orbital separation from just the ratio of the two amplitudes
We investigate the possibility that the large orbital eccentricity of the transiting Neptune-mass planet Gliese 436b is maintained in the face of tidal dissipation by a second planet in the system We find that the currently observed configuration can be understood if Gliese 436b and a putative companion have evolved to a quasi-stationary fixed point in which the planets&#39; orbital apses are co-linear and in which secular variations in the orbital eccentricities of the two planets have been almost entirely damped out
We adopt an octopole-order secular theory based on a Legendre expansion in the semi-major axis ratio to delineate well-defined regions of (P_c M_c e_c) space that can be occupied by a perturbing companion We incorporate the evolutionary effect of tidal dissipation into our secular model of the system and solve the resulting initial value problems for a large sample of the allowed configurations
We then polish the stationary configurations derived from secular theory with full numerical integrations We present our results in the form of candidate companion planets to Gliese 436b For these candidates radial velocity half-amplitudes K_c are of order 3 m/s and the maximum amplitude of orbit-to-orbit transit timing variations are of order Delta t=1 s to Delta t=5s
For the particular example case of a perturber with orbital period P_c=40 d mass M_c=8 5 M_Earth and eccentricity e_c=0 58 we confirm our semi-analytic calculations with a full numerical 3-body integration of the orbital decay that includes tidal damping and spin evolution Additionally we discuss the possibility of many-perturber stationary configurations
With the high number of extrasolar planets discovered by now it becomes possible to constrain theoretical formation models in a statistical sense This paper is the first in a series in which we carry out a large number of planet population synthesis calculations We begin the series with a paper mainly dedicated to the presentation of our approach
but also the discussion of a representative synthetic planetary population of solar like stars Based as tightly as possible on observational data we have derived probability distributions for the most important initial conditions for the planetary formation process We then draw sets of initial conditions from these distributions and obtain the corresponding synthetic planets with our formation model
Although the main purpose of this paper is the description of our methods we present some key results We find that the variation of the initial conditions in the limits occurring in nature leads to the formation of planets of large diversity This formation process is best visualized in planetary formation tracks
where different phases of concurrent growth and migration can be identified These phases lead to the emergence of sub-populations of planets distinguishable in a mass-semimajor axis diagram The most important ones are the &#34;failed cores&#34; a vast group of core-dominated low mass planets the &#34;horizontal branch&#34; a sub-population of Neptune mass planets extending out to 6 AU
Knowledge of the metallicities of M dwarfs rests predominantly on the photometric calibration of Bonfils and collaborators which predicts that M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood including those with known planets are systematically metal-poor compared to their higher-mass counterparts We test this prediction using a volume-limited sample of low-mass stars
together with a subset of M dwarfs with high-metallicity F G amd K wide binary companions We find that the Bonfils et al photometric calibration systematically underestimates the metallicities of our high-metallicity M dwarfs by an average of 0 32 dex We derive a new photometric metallicity calibration and show that M dwarfs with planets appear to be systematically metal-rich
The extrasolar planetary system around HR 8799 is the first multiplanet system ever imaged It is also by a wide margin the highest mass system with &gt;27 Jupiters of planetary mass past 25 AU This is a remarkable system with no analogue with any other known planetary system In the first part of this paper we investigate the nature of two faint objects imaged near the system
These objects are considerably fainter (H=20 4 and 21 6 mag) and more distant (projected separations of 612 and 534 AU) than the three known planetary companions b c and d (68-24 AU) It is possible that these two objects could be lower mass planets (of mass ~5 and ~3 Jupiters) that have been scattered to wider orbits
We make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archival Gemini adaptive optics images to archival HST/NICMOS images With nearly a decade between these epochs we can accurately assess the proper motion nature of each candidate companion We find that both objects are unbound to HR 8799 and are background
We estimate that HR 8799 has no companions of H&lt;22 from ~5-15 arcsec Any scattered giant planets in the HR 8799 system are &gt;600 AU or less than 3 Jupiters in mass In the second part of this paper we carry out a search for wider common proper motion objects
We present radial velocity measurements of two stars observed as part of the Lick Subgiants Planet Search and the Keck N2K survey Variations in the radial velocities of both stars reveal the presence of Jupiter-mass exoplanets in highly eccentric orbits HD 16175 is a G0 subgiant from the Lick Subgiants Planet Search
orbited by a planet having a minimum mass of 4 4 M_Jup in an eccentric (e = 0 59) 2 71 yr orbit HD 96167 is a G5 subgiant from the N2K (&#34;Next 2000&#34;) program at Keck Observatory orbited by a planet having a minimum mass of 0 68 M_Jup
The observed extrasolar planets possess both large masses (with a median M sin i of 1 65 MJ) and a wide range in orbital eccentricity (0 &lt; e &lt; 0 94) As planets are thought to form in circumstellar disks one important question in planet formation is determining whether and to what degree
a gaseous disk affects an eccentric planet&#39;s orbit Recent studies have probed the interaction between a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit and the interaction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit but little is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas giant
Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still present or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability We fill this gap with simulations of eccentric massive (gap-forming) planets in disks using the hydrodynamical code FARGO Although the long-term orbital evolution of the planet depends on disk properties
Sharp density features in protoplanetary discs for instance at the edge of a magnetically dead zone have recently been proposed as effective barriers to slow down or even stop the problematically fast migration of planetary cores into their central star Density features on a radial scale approaching the disc vertical scale height might not exist
however since they could be Rayleigh (or more generally Solberg-Hoiland) unstable Stability must be checked explicitly in one-dimensional viscous accretion disc models because these instabilities are artificially eliminated in the process of reducing the full set of axisymmetric equations The disc thermodynamics via the entropy stratification and its vertical structure also influence stability when sharp density features are present
The hot Neptune orbiting around GJ 436 is a unique example of an intermediate mass planet Its close-in orbit suggests that the planet has undergone migration and its study is fundamental to understanding planet formation and evolution As it transits its parent star it is the only Neptune-mass extrasolar planet of known mass and radius
being slightly larger and more massive than Neptune (M=22 6 M_Earth R=4 19R_Earth) In this regime several bulk compositions are possible from an Earth-like core with a thick hydrogen envelope to a water-rich planet with a thin hydrogen envelope comprising a Neptune-like structure We combine planet-structure modeling with an advanced planet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulk compositions of GJ 436 b
We find that both an envelope-free water planet (&#34;Ocean planet&#34;) as well as a diminute version of a gaseous giant planet are excluded Consisting of a rocky core with a thick hydrogen/helium envelope a &#34;dry&#34; composition produces not only too small a radius but is also a very unlikely outcome of planet formation around such a low-mass star
We conclude that GJ 436 b is probably of much higher rock content than Neptune (more than 45% in mass) with a small H-He envelope (10 - 20% in mass) This is the expected outcome of the gathering of materials during the migration process in the inner disk creating a population of which the hot Neptune is representative
This is the second paper in a series of papers showing the results of extrasolar planet population synthesis calculations In the companion paper (Paper I) we have presented in detail our methods By applying an observational detection bias for radial velocity surveys we identify the potentially detectable synthetic planets The properties of these planets are compared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully selected sub-population of actual exoplanets
We use a two dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic and observed planets as well as 1D KS tests to compare the mass the semimajor axis and the [Fe/H] distributions We find that some models can account to a reasonable degree of significance for the observed properties
We concurrently account for many other observed features e g the &#34;metallicity effect&#34; This gives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant planet formation Our simulations allow us also to extract the properties of the underlying exoplanet population that are not yet detectable For example we have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to conclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the iceberg
Hot super-Earths are exoplanets with masses &lt; 10 Earth masses and orbital periods &lt; 20 days Around 8 hot super-Earths have been discovered in the neighborhood of solar system In this lecture we review the mechanisms for the formation of hot super-Earths dynamical effects that play important roles in sculpting the architecture of the multiple planetary systems
High-dispersion (l/dl ~ 25 000) infrared spectra of Comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) were acquired on Nov 28-29 2004 and Jan 19 2005 (UT dates) with NIRSPEC at the Keck-2 telescope on Mauna Kea We detected H2O CH4 C2H2 C2H6 CO H2CO CH3OH HCN and NH3 and we conducted a sensitive search for CH3D
We report rotational temperatures production rates and mixing ratios (with respect to H2O) at heliocentric distances of 1 49 AU (Nov 2004) and 1 21 AU (Jan 2005) We highlight three principal results (1) The mixing ratios of parent volatiles measured at 1 49 AU and 1 21 AU agree within confidence limits
consistent with homogeneous composition in the mean volatile release from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2 Notably the relative abundance of C2H6/C2H2 is substantially higher than those measured in other comets while the mixing ratios C2H6/H2O CH3OH/H2O and HCN/H2O are similar to those observed in comets referred to as &#34;organics-normal&#34; (2) The spin temperature of CH4 is &gt; 35-38 K
an estimate consistent with the more robust spin temperature found for H2O (3) We obtained a 3s upper limit of CH3D/CH4 &lt; 0 020 (D/H &lt; 0 005) This limit suggests that methane released from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2 is not dominated by a component formed in extremely cold (near 10 K) environments
Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations indicate that several transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their upper atmospheres Above a relative minimum the temperature appears to increase with altitude Such an inversion probably requires a species at high altitude that absorbs a significant amount of incident optical/UV radiation Some authors have suggested that the strong optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) could provide the needed additional opacity
However if regions of the atmosphere are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into solids they might rain out and be severely depleted With a model of the vertical distribution of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form we address the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in an irradiated planet&#39;s atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion
We find that without significant macroscopic mixing a heavy species such as TiO -- especially one that can condense in a cold-trap region -- cannot persist in a planet&#39;s upper atmosphere In our model the amount of macroscopic mixing that would be required to loft TiO to millibar pressures ranges from ~10^7 to ~10^{11} cm^2/s on HD 209458b
Action of solar wind on arbitrarily shaped interplanetary dust particle is investigated The final relativistically covariant equation of motion of the particle contains both orbital evolution and change of particle&#39;s mass Non-radial solar wind velocity vector is also included The covariant equation of motion reduces to the Poynting-Robertson effect in the limiting case when spherical particle is treated
the speed of the incident solar wind corpuscles tends to the speed of light and the corpuscles spread radially from the Sun The results of quantum mechanics have to be incorporated into the physical considerations in order to obtain the limiting case The condition for the solar wind effect on motion of spherical interplanetary dust particle is $\vec{p}&#39;_{out}$ $=$ (1 $-$ $\sigma&#39;_{pr} / \sigma&#39;_{tot}$) $\vec{p}&#39;_{in}$
where $\vec{p}&#39;_{in}$ and $\vec{p}&#39;_{out}$ are incoming and outgoing radiation momenta (per unit time) measured in the proper frame of reference of the particle; $\sigma&#39;_{pr}$ and $\sigma&#39;_{tot}$ are solar wind pressure and total scattering cross sections <br>Real flux density of solar wind energy produces shift of perihelion of interplanetary dust particles
This result significantly differs from the standard treatment of the action of the solar wind on dust particles when analogy with the Poynting-Robertson effect is stressed Moreover the evolution of the shift of perihelion depends on orbital position of the parent body at the time of ejection of the particle
This paper studies the mean angular momentum associated with the collision of two celestial objects in the earliest stages of planet formation Of primary concern is the scenario of two rarefied preplanetesimals (RPPs) in circular heliocentric orbits The theoretical results are used to develop models of binary or multiple system formation from RPPs
and explain the observation that a greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun At the stage of RPPs small-body satellites can form in two ways a merger between RPPs can have two centers of contraction or the formation of satellites from a disc around the primary or the secondary
Formation of the disc can be caused by that the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the critical angular momentum for a solid body One or several satellites of the primary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc at any separation less than the Hill radius
The first scenario can explain a system such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are separated by a great distance In general any values for the eccentricity and inclination of the mutual orbit are possible Among discovered binaries the observed angular momenta are smaller than the typical angular momenta expected for identical RPPs having the same total mass as the discovered binary and encountering each other in circular heliocentric orbits
We report a times series of B-band photometric observations initiated on the eve of Valentine&#39;s day February 14 2009 at the anticipated time of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD 80606b The same transit has been observed independently (Fossey et al 2009; Moutou et al 2009) For one transit model favored by the data
minimum light equals 0 990 times the nominal brightness of HD 80606 and occurs at HJD 2454876 33 The latter time combined with the orbital period $P = 111 4277 \pm 0 0032$ days longitude of periastron $\omega = 300 4977 \pm 0 0045$ degrees and time of mid-secondary eclipse HJD $2454424
refines the orbital eccentricity and inclination The duration of the model transit is 0 47 days and its four contacts occur at HJD 2454876 plus 0 10 0 24 0 42 and 0 57 days We describe parameterizations of a transit model with mutually accommodating eccentricity $e = 0 9337^{+0
Some transiting extrasolar giant planets have measured radii larger than predicted by the standard theory In this paper we explore the possibility that an earlier episode of tidal heating can explain such radius anomalies and apply the formalism we develop to HD 209458b as an example We find that for strong enough tides the planet&#39;s radius can undergo a transient phase of inflation that temporarily interrupts canonical
monotonic shrinking due to radiative losses Importantly an earlier episode of tidal heating can result in a planet with an inflated radius even though its orbit has nearly circularized Moreover we confirm that at late times and under some circumstances by raising tides on the star itself a planet can spiral into its host
We note that a 3$\times$ to 10$\times$solar planet atmospheric opacity with no tidal heating is sufficient to explain the observed radius of HD 209458b However our model demonstrates that with an earlier phase of episodic tidal heating we can fit the observed radius of HD 209458b even with lower (solar) atmospheric opacities
This work demonstrates that if a planet is left with an appreciable eccentricity after early inward migration and/or dynamical interaction coupling radius and orbit evolution in a consistent fashion that includes tidal heating stellar irradiation and detailed model atmospheres might offer a generic solution to the inflated radius puzzle for transiting extrasolar giant planets such as WASP-12b
We estimate the conditions for detectability of two planets in a 2/1 mean-motion resonance from radial velocity data as a function of their masses number of observations and the signal-to-noise ratio Even for a data set of the order of 100 observations and standard deviations of the order of a few meters per second
we find that Jovian-size resonant planets are difficult to detect if the masses of the planets differ by a factor larger than $\sim 4$ This is consistent with the present population of real exosystems in the 2/1 commensurability most of which have resonant pairs with similar minimum masses and could indicate that many other resonant systems exist
but are presently beyond the detectability limit <br>Furthermore we analyze the error distribution in masses and orbital elements of orbital fits from synthetic data sets for resonant planets in the 2/1 commensurability For various mass ratios and number of data points we find that the eccentricity of the outer planet is systematically over estimated
MARVELS the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey is a 6-year program to characterize the distribution of gas giant planets with orbital periods ranging from several hours to two years MARVELS will use multi-fiber interferometric spectrographs on the wide-field 2 5-meter Sloan Foundation telescope at Apache Point Observatory to monitor ~11
visiting each star ~30 times over an 18-month interval with velocity precision of 14 18 and 35 m/s at V=8 10 and 12 MARVELS will survey far more stars with a wider range of spectral types and metallicities than previous radial velocity searches yielding a statistically well defined sample of ~150 giant planets drawn from a host sample with well understood selection biases
With a unique combination of large numbers and well characterized sensitivity MARVELS will provide a critical data set for testing theories of the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems The MARVELS detections will also be an ideal sample for follow-up observations to identify multiple planet systems and understand the influence of giant planet migration on the formation and survival of less massive planets
While the number of asteroids with known shapes has drastically increased over the past few years little is known on the the time-evolution of shapes and the underlying physical processes Here we propose an averaged abrasion model based on micro-collisons accounting for asteroids not necessarily evolving toward regular spheroids rather (depending on the fall-back rate of ejecta) following an alternative path
We have investigated planetary accretion from planetesimals in terrestrial planet regions inside the ice line around M dwarf stars through N-body simulations including tidal interactions with disk gas Because of low luminosity of M dwarfs habitable zones (HZs) are located in inner regions In the close-in HZ type-I migration and the orbital decay induced by eccentricity damping are efficient according to the high disk gas density in the small orbital radii
In the case of full efficiency of type-I migration predicted by the linear theory we found that protoplanets that migrate to the vicinity of the host star undergo close scatterings and collisions and 4 to 6 planets eventually remain in mutual mean motion resonances and their orbits have small eccentricities and they are stable both before and after disk gas decays
In the case of slow migration the resonant capture is so efficient that densely-packed ~ 40 small protoplanets remain in mutual mean motion resonances In this case they start orbit crossing after the disk gas decays and eccentricity damping due to tidal interaction with gas is no more effective Through merging of the protoplanets
several planets in widely-separated non-resonant orbits with relatively large eccentricities are formed Thus the final orbital configurations of the terrestrial planets around M dwarfs sensitively depend on strength of type-I migration We also found that large amount of water-ice is delivered by type-I migration from outer regions and final planets near the inner disk edge around M dwarfs are generally abundant in water-ice except for the innermost one that is shielded by the outer planets
This paper deals with the problem of astrometric determination of the orbital elements of the outer planets in particular by assessing the ability of astrometric observations to detect perturbations of the sort expected from the Pioneer effect or other small perturbations to gravity We also show that while using simplified models of the dynamics can lead to some insights
one must be careful to not over-simplify the issues involved lest one be misled by the analysis onto false paths Specifically we show that the current ephemeris of Pluto does not preclude the existence of the Pioneer effect We show that the orbit of Pluto is simply not well enough characterized at present to make such an assertion
A number of misunderstandings related to these topics have now propagated through the literature and have been used as a basis for drawing conclusions about the dynamics of the solar system Thus the objective of this paper is to address these issues Finally we offer some comments dealing with the complex topic of model selection and comparison
The magnetospheric emissions from extrasolar planets represent a science frontier for the next decade All of the solar system giant planets and the Earth produce radio emissions as a result of interactions between their magnetic fields and the solar wind In the case of the Earth its magnetic field may contribute to its habitability by protecting its atmosphere from solar wind erosion and by preventing energetic particles from reaching its surface
Indirect evidence for at least some extrasolar giant planets also having magnetic fields includes the modulation of emission lines of their host stars phased with the planetary orbits likely due to interactions between the stellar and planetary magnetic fields If magnetic fields are a generic property of giant planets then extrasolar giant planets should emit at radio wavelengths allowing for their direct detection
Epimetheus a small moon of Saturn has a rotational libration (an oscillation about synchronous rotation) of 5 9 +- 1 2 degrees placing Epimetheus in the company of Earth&#39;s Moon and Mars&#39; Phobos as the only natural satellites for which forced rotational libration has been detected The forced libration is caused by the satellite&#39;s slightly eccentric orbit and non-spherical shape
<br>Detection of a moon&#39;s forced libration allows us to probe its interior by comparing the measured amplitude to that predicted by a shape model assuming constant density A discrepancy between the two would indicate internal density asymmetries For Epimetheus the uncertainties in the shape model are large enough to account for the measured libration amplitude
For Janus on the other hand although we cannot rule out synchronous rotation a permanent offset of several degrees between Janus&#39; minimum moment of inertia (long axis) and the equilibrium sub-Saturn point may indicate that Janus does have modest internal density asymmetries <br>The rotation states of Janus and Epimetheus experience a perturbation every four years
as the two moons &#34;swap&#34; orbits The sudden change in the orbital periods produces a free libration about synchronous rotation that is subsequently damped by internal friction We calculate that this free libration is small in amplitude (&lt;0 1 degree) and decays quickly (a few weeks at most) and is thus below the current limits for detection using Cassini images
In the recent years we have performed various experiments on the collision dynamics of highly porous dust aggregates and although we now have a comprehensive picture of the micromechanics of those aggregates the macroscopic understanding is still lacking We are therefore developing a mechanical model to describe dust aggregate collisions with macroscopic parameters like tensile strength
compressive strength and shear strength For one well defined dust sample material the tensile and compressive strength were measured in a static experiment and implemented in a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code A laboratory experiment was designed to compare the laboratory results with the results of the SPH simulation In this experiment
a mm-sized glass bead is dropped into a cm-sized dust aggregate with the previously measured strength parameters We determine the deceleration of the glass bead by high-speed imaging and the compression of the dust aggregate by x-ray micro-tomography The measured penetration depth stopping time and compaction under the glass bead are utilized to calibrate and test the SPH code
We analyze the long-term tidal evolution of a single-planet system through the use of numerical simulations and averaged equations giving the variations of semi-major axis and eccentricity of the relative orbit For different types of planets we compute the variations due to the planetary and stellar tides Then we calculate the critical value of the eccentricity for which the stellar tide becomes dominant over the planetary tide
To gain a better understanding of the surfaces of planets and small bodies in the solar system the flow behavior of granular material for various gravity levels is of utmost interest We performed a set of reduced-gravity measurements to analyze the flow behavior of granular matter with a quasi-2D hourglass under coarse-vacuum conditions and with a tilting avalanche box
We used the Bremen drop tower and a small centrifuge to achieve residual-gravity levels between 0 01 g and 0 3 g Both experiments were carried out with basalt and glass grains as well as with two kinds of ordinary sand For the hourglass experiments the volume flow through the orifice
In the currently-favored paradigm of planet formation the location of the snow line in the protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role Determining the demographics of planets beyond the snow line of stars of various masses is thus essential for testing this model Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods
and in particular is most sensitive to cool planets at or beyond the snow line including very low-mass (i e terrestrial) planets Hence microlensing is uniquely suited and so essential for a comprehensive study of this region Microlensing is also sensitive to planets orbiting low-mass stars free-floating planets planets in the Galactic bulge and disk
and even planets in external galaxies These planets can also provide critical constraints on models of planet formation Although microlensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets these have already changed our understanding of planet formation beyond the snow line Next generation microlensing surveys which would be sensitive to tens of &#34;cold Earths&#34; in this region
The recent discovery of a three-planet extrasolar system of HR 8799 by Marois et al is a breakthrough in the field of the direct imaging This great achievement raises questions on the formation and dynamical stability of the HR 8799 system because Keplerian fits to astrometric data are strongly unstable during ~0
We search for stable self-consistent N-body orbits with the so called GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the optimization algorithm Our searches reveal only small regions of stable motions in the phase space of three-planet coplanar configurations Most likely if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range they may be stable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion resonances (MMRs)
We found that 80% systems found by GAMP that survived 30Myr backwards integrations eventually become unstable after 100Myr It could mean that the HR 8799 system undergo a phase of planet-planet scattering We test a hypothesis that the less certain detection of the innermost object is due to a blending effect
Compared to bright star searches surveys for transiting planets against fainter (V=12-18) stars have the advantage of much higher sky densities of dwarf star primaries which afford easier detection of small transiting bodies Furthermore deep searches are capable of probing a wider range of stellar environments On the other hand
for a given spatial resolution and transit depth deep searches are more prone to confusion from blended eclipsing binaries We present a powerful mitigation strategy for the blending problem that includes the use of image deconvolution and high resolution imaging The techniques are illustrated with Lupus-TR-3 and very recent IR imaging with PANIC on Magellan
Multi-wavelength spectroscopy can be used to constrain the dust and gas properties in debris disks Circumstellar dust absorbs and scatters incident stellar light The scattered light is sometimes resolved spatially at visual and near-infrared wavelengths using high contrast imaging techniques that suppress light from the central star The thermal emission is inferred from infrared through submillimeter excess emission that may be 1-2 orders of magnitude brighter than the stellar photosphere alone
If the disk is not spatially resolved then the radial distribution of the dust can be inferred from Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling If the grains are sufficiently small and warm then their composition can be determined from mid-infrared spectroscopy Otherwise their composition may be determined from reflectance and/or far-infrared spectroscopy
We present here HST NICMOS F110W and F160W observations of Haumea and its two satellites Hi&#39;iaka and Namaka From the measured (F110W-F160W) colours of -1 209 +/-0 004 -1 48 +/- 0 06 and -1 4 +/- 0 2 mag for each object respectively we infer that the 1 6 imcron water-ice absorption feature depths on Hi&#39;iaka and Namaka are at least as deep as that of Haumea
By examining the absolute magnitude (H) distributions (hereafter HD) of the cold and hot populations in the Kuiper belt and of the Trojans of Jupiter we find evidence that the Trojans have been captured from the outer part of the primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimal disk We develop a sketch model of the HDs in the inner and outer parts of the disk that is consistent with the observed distributions and with the dynamical evolution scenario known as the `Nice model&#39;
This leads us to predict that the HD of hot population should have the same slope of the HD of the cold population for 6 5 &lt; H &lt; 9 both as steep as the slope of the Trojans&#39; HD Current data partially support this prediction but future observations are needed to clarify this issue
Because the HD of the Trojans rolls over at H~9 to a collisional equilibrium slope that should have been acquired when the Trojans were still embedded in the primordial trans-Neptunian disk our model implies that the same roll-over should characterize the HDs of the Kuiper belt populations in agreement with the results of Bernstein et al
We examine the effects of dynamical evolution in clusters on planetary systems or protoplanetary disks orbiting the components of binary stars In particular we look for evidence that the companions of host stars of planetary systems or disks could have their inclination angles raised from zero to between the threshold angles (39
We find that up to 20 per cent of binary systems have their inclination angles increased to within the threshold range Given that half of all extrasolar planets could be in binary systems we suggest that up to 10 per cent of extrasolar planets could be affected by this mechanism
We analyzed the Subaru/Suprime-Cam images of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3B and detected no fewer than 154 mini-comets We applied synchrone-syndyne analysis modified for rocket effect analysis to the mini-fragment spatial distribution We found that most of these mini-comets were ejected from fragment B by an outburst occurring around 1 April 2006 The ratio of the rocket force to solar gravity was 7 to 23 times larger than that exerted on fragment B
No significant color variation was found We examined the surface brightness profiles of all detected fragments and estimated the sizes of 154 fragments We found that the radius of these mini-fragments was in the 5- to 108-m range (equivalent size of Tunguska impactor) The power-law index of the differential size distribution was q = -3
Based on this size distribution we found that about 1-10% of the mass of fragment B was lost in the April 2006 outbursts Modeling the cometary fragment dynamics revealed that it is likely that mini-fragments smaller than ~10-20 m could be depleted in water ice and become inactive implying that decameter-sized comet fragments could survive against melting and remain as near-Earth objects
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant impacts on the Earth during the last billion years The gamma radiation from a burst within a few kiloparsecs would quickly deplete much of the Earth&#39;s protective ozone layer allowing an increase in solar ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface
This radiation is harmful to life damaging DNA and causing sunburn In addition NO2 produced in the atmosphere would cause a decrease in visible sunlight reaching the surface and could cause global cooling Nitric acid rain could stress portions of the biosphere but the increased nitrate deposition could be helpful to land plants
We have used a two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth&#39;s atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences at various latitudes at the equinoxes and solstices and at different times of day We have estimated DNA damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation reduction in solar visible light due to NO2 opacity
We report on the discovery of HAT-P-12b a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the moderately bright V=12 8 K4 dwarf GSC 03033-00706 with a period P = 3 2130598 +- 0 0000021 d transit epoch Tc = 2454419 19556 +- 0 00020 (BJD) and transit duration 0 0974 +- 0 0006 d
The host star has a mass of 0 73 +- 0 02 Msun radius of 0 70 +- ^0 02_0 01 Rsun effective temperature 4650 +- 60 K and metallicity [Fe/H] = -0 29 +- 0 05 We find a slight correlation between the observed spectral line bisector spans and the radial velocity
so we consider and rule out various blend configurations including a blend with a background eclipsing binary and hierarchical triple systems where the eclipsing body is a star or a planet We conclude that a model consisting of a single star with a transiting planet best fits the observations and show that a likely explanation for the apparent correlation is contamination from scattered moonlight
Based on this model the planetary companion has a mass of 0 211 +- 0 012 MJup and a radius of 0 959 +- ^0 029_0 021 RJup yielding a mean density of 0 295 +- 0 025 g cm^-3 Comparing these observations with recent theoretical models we find that HAT-P-12b is consistent with a ~ 1-4
We develop a new 1D photochemical kinetics code to address stratospheric chemistry and stratospheric heating in hot Jupiters Here we address optically active S-containing species and CO2 at 1200 &lt; T &lt; 2000 K HS (mercapto) and S2 are highly reactive species that are generated photochemically and thermochemically from H2S with peak abundances between 1-10 mbar
S2 absorbs UV between 240 and 340 nm and is optically thick for metallicities [SH] &gt; 0 at T &gt; 1200 K HS is probably more important than S2 as it is generally more abundant than S2 under hot Jupiter conditions and it absorbs at somewhat redder wavelengths We use molecular theory to compute an HS absorption spectrum from sparse available data and find that HS should absorb strongly between 300 and 460 nm
with absorption at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive When the two absorbers are combined radiative heating (per kg of gas) peaks at 100 microbars with a total stratospheric heating of about 8 x 10^4 W/m^2 for a jovian planet orbiting a solar-twin at 0 032 AU Total heating is insensitive to metallicity
The CO2 mixing ratio is a well-behaved quadratic function of metallicity ranging from 1 6 x 10^-8 to 1 6 x 10^-4 for -0 3 &lt; [M/H] &lt; 1 7 CO2 is insensitive to insolation vertical mixing temperature (1200 &lt; T &lt;2000 K) and gravity The photochemical calculations confirm that CO2 should prove a useful probe of planetary metallicity
Sokoloski et al (2008) have recently reported evidence that the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi produced a pair of highly collimated radio jets within days of its 2006 outburst This suggests that an accretion disc must be present during the outburst However in the standard picture of recurrent novae as thermonuclear events
any such disc must be expelled from the white dwarf vicinity as the nuclear energy yield greatly exceeds its binding energy We suggest instead that the outbursts of RS Oph are thermal--viscous instabilities in a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf The distinctive feature of RS Oph is the very large size of its accretion disc
Given this it fits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretion discs This picture explains the presence and speed of the jets the brightness and duration of the outburst and its rise time and linear decay as well as the faintness of the quiescence By contrast the hitherto standard picture of recurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties
We summarize the analytic model and numerical simulations of stochastically forced planets in a turbulent disk presented in a recent paper by Rein and Papaloizou We identify two modes of libration in systems with planets in mean motion resonance which react differently to random forces The slow mode which mostly corresponds to motion of the angle between the apsidal lines of the two planets
is converted to circulation more readily than the fast mode which is associated with oscillations of the semi-major axes <br>We therefore conclude that stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have played an important role in shaping the configuration of observed systems in mean motion resonance For example it naturally provides a mechanism for accounting for the HD128311 system for which the fast mode librates and the slow mode does not
Extrasolar multiple-planet systems provide valuable opportunities for testing theories of planet formation and evolution The architectures of the known multiple-planet systems demonstrate a fascinating level of diversity which motivates the search for additional examples of such systems in order to better constrain their formation and dynamical histories Here we describe a comprehensive investigation of 22 planetary systems in an effort to answer three questions
these new data do not support three previously announced planets (HD 20367b Udry et al 2003 HD 74156d Bean et al 2008 and 47 UMa c Fischer et al 2002) The dynamical simulations show that nearly all of the 22 systems have large regions in which additional planets could exist in stable orbits
In 1981 Beta Pictoris showed strong and rapid photometric variations that were attributed to the transit of a giant comet or a planet orbiting at several AUs (Lecavelier des Etangs et al 1994 1995 1997; Lamers et al 1997) Recently a candidate planet has been identified by imagery in the circumstellar disk of Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al
This planet named Beta Pic b is observed at a projected distance of 8AU from the central star It is therefore a plausible candidate for the photometric event observed in 1981 The coincidence of the observed position of the planet in November 2003 and the calculated position assuming that the 1981 transit is due to a planet orbiting at 8 AU is intriguing
Assuming that the planet that is detected on the image is the same as the object transiting in November 1981 we estimate ranges of possible orbital distances and periods In the favored scenario the planet orbits at about 8 AU and was seen close to its quadrature position in the 2003 images
In this case most of the uncertainties are related to error bars on the position in 2003 Uncertainties related to the stellar mass and orbital eccentricity are also discussed We find a semi-major axis in the range [7 6-8 7] AU and an orbital period in the range [15 9-19
We investigate the evaporation history of known transiting exoplanets in order to consider the origin of observed correlations between mass surface gravity and orbital period We show that the survival of the known planets at their current separations is consistent with a simple model of evaporation but that many of the same planets would not have survived closer to their host stars
These putative closer-in systems represent a lost population that could account for the observed correlations We conclude that the relation underlying the correlations noted by Mazeh et al (2005) and Southworth et al (2007) is most likely a linear cut-off in the M^2/R^3 vs a^-2 plane and we show that the distribution of exoplanets in this plane is in close agreement with the evaporation model
We report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet HD 80606 b thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed at Observatoire de Haute-Provence simultaneously with the CCD camera at the 120-cm telescope and the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope We observed the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part
in both data sets with the same timings The ingress occurred before sunset and was not observed The full duration of the transit was between 9 5 and 17 2 hours The data allows the planetary radius to be measured (Rp = 0 9 +- 0 1 RJup) and other parameters of the system to be refined
Radial velocity measurements show the detection of a prograde Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and provide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment If confirmed this misalignment would corroborate the hypothesis that HD 80606 b owes its unusual orbital configuration to Kozai migration HD 80606 b is by far the transiting planet on the longest period detected today
We investigate the properties of circumplanetary discs formed in three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical models of gas accretion by protoplanets We determine disc sizes scaleheights and density and temperature profiles for different protoplanet masses in solar nebulae of differing grain opacities <br>We find that the analytical prediction of circumplanetary disc radii in an evacuated gap (R_Hill/3) from Quillen &amp; Trilling (1998) yields a good estimate for discs formed by high mass protoplanets
The radial density profiles of the circumplanetary discs may be described by power-laws between r^-2 and r^-3/2 We find no evidence for the ring-like density enhancements that have been found in some previous models of circumplanetary discs Temperature profiles follow a ~r^-7/10 power-law regardless of protoplanet mass or nebula grain opacity
We have confirmed the existence of the transiting super Neptune extrasolar planet HAT-P-11b On May 1 2009 UT the transit of HAT-P-11b was detected at the University of Arizona&#39;s 1 55m Kuiper Telescope with 1 7 millimag rms accuracy We find a central transit time of T_c = 2454952 92534+/-0
Hence our transit timing rules out the presence of any large (&gt;200 s) deviations from the ephemeris of Bakos et al (2009) We obtain a slightly more accurate period of P=4 8878045+/-0 0000043 days We measure a slightly larger planetary radius of R_p=0 452+/-0 020 R_J (5 07+/-0 22 R_earth) compared to Bakos and co-workers&#39; value of 0
Politano and Pouquet&#39;s law a generalization of Kolmogorov&#39;s four-fifths law to incompressible MHD makes it possible to measure the energy cascade rate in incompressible MHD turbulence by means of third-order moments In hydrodynamics accurate measurement of third-order moments requires large amounts of data because the probability distributions of velocity-differences are nearly symmetric and the third-order moments are relatively small
Measurements of the energy cascade rate in solar wind turbulence have recently been performed for the first time but without careful consideration of the accuracy or statistical uncertainty of the required third-order moments This paper investigates the statistical convergence of third-order moments as a function of the sample size N
The known extrasolar multiple-planet systems share a surprising dynamical attribute they cluster just beyond the Hill stability boundary Here we show that the planet-planet scattering model which naturally explains the observed exoplanet eccentricity distribution can reproduce the observed distribution of dynamical configurations We calculated how each of our scattered systems would appear over an appropriate range of viewing geometries; as Hill stability is weakly dependent on the masses
the mass-inclination degeneracy does not significantly affect our results We consider a wide range of initial planetary mass distributions and find that some are poor fits to the observed systems In fact many of our scattering experiments overproduce systems very close to the stability boundary The distribution of dynamical configurations of two-planet systems actually may provide better discrimination between scattering models than the distribution of eccentricity
We report Spitzer Space Telescope observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at 5 5 and 4 3 AU from the Sun post-aphelion Comet 67P is the primary target of the European Space Agency&#39;s Rosetta mission The Rosetta spacecraft will rendezvous with the nucleus at heliocentric distances similar to our observations Rotationally resolved observations at 8 and 24 microns (at a heliocentric distance
rh of 4 8 AU) that sample the size and color-temperature of the nucleus are combined with aphelion R-band light curves observed at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and yield a mean effective radius of 2 04 +/- 0 11 km and an R-band geometric albedo of 0 054 +/- 0
The amplitudes of the R-band and mid-infrared light curves agree which suggests that the variability is dominated by the shape of the nucleus We also detect the dust trail of the comet at 4 8 and 5 5 AU constrain the grain sizes to be less than or similar to 6 mm
and estimate the impact hazard to Rosetta We find no evidence for recently ejected dust in our images If the activity of 67P is consistent from orbit to orbit then we may expect the Rosetta spacecraft will return images of an inactive or weakly active nucleus as it rendezvous with the comet at rh = 4 AU in 2014
(Abriged) The existence of large-scale and long-lived 2D vortices in accretion discs has been debated for more than a decade They appear spontaneously in several 2D disc simulations and they are known to accelerate planetesimal formation through a dust trapping process However the issue of the stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still not fully understood
and it casts doubts on their long term survival <br>Aim We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices embedded in accretion discs based on a linear analysis and several non-linear simulations <br>Methods We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in the core of an elliptical vortex
and we show that they can be reduced to a Floquet problem We solve this problem numerically in the astrophysical regime and we present several analytical limits for which the mechanism responsible for the instability can be explained Finally we compare the results of the linear analysis to some high resolution simulations
<br>Results We show that most anticyclonic vortices are unstable due to a resonance between the turnover time and the local epicyclic oscillation period In addition we demonstrate that a strong vertical stratification does not create any additional stable domain of aspect ratio but it significantly reduces growth rates for relatively weak (and therefore elongated) vortices
I report the results from a study of the transit times for CoRoT-1b which was one of the first planets discovered by CoRoT Analysis of the pipeline reduced CoRoT light curve yields a new determination of the physical and orbital parameters of planet and star along with 35 individual transit times at a typical precision of 36 s
I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of 0 1433 +/- 0 0010 a ratio of the planet&#39;s orbital semimajor axis to the host star radius of 4 751 +/- 0 045 and an orbital inclination for the planet of 83 88 +/- 0 29 deg The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b having a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in the system
I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on the mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby stable orbit I ascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can be placed on planets residing in a 1 2 mean motion resonance with the transiting planet
In contrast the data yield less stringent limits on planets near a 1 3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the surrounding parameter space In addition I use a simulation to investigate what sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of data measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential transit times)
I find that for such a scenario planets with masses greater than twice that of Mars (0 2 M_earth) in the 1 2 mean motion resonance would cause high-significance transit time deviations Therefore such planets could be detected or ruled out using CoRoT long run data I conclude that CoRoT data will indeed be very useful for searching for planets with the transit timing method
Mutual event observations between the two components of 90 Antiope were carried out in 2007-2008 The pole position was refined to lambda0 = 199 5+/-0 5 eg and beta0 = 39 8+/-5 deg in J2000 ecliptic coordinates leaving intact the physical solution for the components assimilated to two perfect Roche ellipsoids
and derived after the 2005 mutual event season (Descamps et al 2007) Furthermore a large-scale geological depression located on one of the components was introduced to better match the observed lightcurves This vast geological feature of about 68 km in diameter which could be postulated as a bowl-shaped impact crater
is indeed responsible of the photometric asymmetries seen on the &#34;shoulders&#34; of the lightcurves The bulk density was then recomputed to 1 28+/-0 04 gcm-3 to take into account this large-scale non-convexity This giant crater could be the aftermath of a tremendous collision of a 100-km sized proto-Antiope with another Themis family member
This statement is supported by the fact that Antiope is sufficiently porous (~50%) to survive such an impact without being wholly destroyed This violent shock would have then imparted enough angular momentum for fissioning of proto-Antiope into two equisized bodies We calculated that the impactor must have a diameter greater than ~17 km
We present an analysis of three years of precision radial velocity measurements of 160 metal-poor stars observed with HIRES on the Keck 1 telescope We report on variability and long-term velocity trends for each star in our sample We identify several long-term low-amplitude radial-velocity variables worthy of follow-up with direct imaging techniques
We place lower limits on the detectable companion mass as a function of orbital period Our survey would have detected with a 99 5% confidence level over 95% of all companions on low-eccentricity orbits with velocity semi-amplitude K &gt; 100 m/s or M_p*sin(i) &gt; 3 0 M_JUP*(P/yr)^(1/3) for orbital periods P&lt; 3 yr
None of the stars in our sample exhibits radial-velocity variations compatible with the presence of Jovian planets with periods shorter than the survey duration The resulting average frequency of gas giants orbiting metal-poor dwarfs with -2 0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -0 6 is f_p&lt;0 67% (at the 1-sigma confidence level)
We examine the implications of this null result in the context of the observed correlation between the rate of occurrence of giant planets and the metallicity of their main-sequence solar-type stellar hosts By combining our dataset with the Fischer &amp; Valenti (2005) uniform sample we confirm that the likelihood of a star to harbor a planet more massive than Jupiter within 2 AU is a steeply rising function of the host&#39;s metallicity
The identification of a universal biosignature that could be sensed remotely is critical to the prospects for success in the search for life elsewhere in the universe A candidate universal biosignature is homochirality which is likely to be a generic property of all biochemical life Due to the optical activity of chiral molecules
it has been hypothesized that this unique characteristic may provide a suitable remote sensing probe using circular polarization spectroscopy Here we report the detection of circular polarization in light scattered by photosynthetic microbes We show that the circular polarization appears to arise from circular dichroism of the strong electronic transitions of photosynthetic absorption bands
We present N-body simulations of planetary accretion beginning with 1 km radius planetesimals in orbit about a 1 solar mass star at 0 4 AU The initial disk of planetesimals contains too many bodies for any current N-body code to integrate; therefore we model a sample patch of the disk
Although this greatly reduces the number of bodies we still track in excess of 10^5 particles We consider three initial velocity distributions and monitor the growth of the planetesimals The masses of some particles increase by more than a factor of 100 Additionally the escape speed of the largest particle grows considerably faster than the velocity dispersion of the particles
suggesting impending runaway growth although no particle grows large enough to detach itself from the power law size-frequency distribution These results are in general agreement with previous statistical and analytical results We compute rotation rates by assuming conservation of angular momentum around the center of mass at impact and that merged planetesimals relax to spherical shapes
At the end of our simulations the majority of bodies that have undergone at least one merger are rotating faster than the breakup frequency This implies that the assumption of completely inelastic collisions (perfect accretion) which is made in most simulations of planetary growth at sizes 1 km and above
We present nine newly observed transits of TrES-3 taken as part of a transit timing program using the RISE instrument on the Liverpool Telescope A Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis was used to determine the planet-star radius ratio and inclination of the system which were found to be Rp/Rstar=0 1664^{+0 0011}_{-0 0018} and i = 81
consistent with previous results The central transit times and uncertainties were also calculated using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independent check on the errors A re-analysis of eight previously published TrES-3 light curves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties using consistent techniques Whilst the transit times were not found to be in agreement with a linear ephemeris
giving chi^2 = 35 07 for 15 degrees of freedom we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curves rather than a real transit timing variation This is because the light curves that show the largest deviation from a constant period either have relatively little out-of-transit coverage
or have clear systematics A new ephemeris was calculated using the transit times and was found to be T_c(0) = 2454632 62610 +- 0 00006 HJD and P = 1 3061864 +- 0 0000005 days The transit times were then used to place upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio of a potential perturbing planet
Fomalhaut and epsilon Eridani are two young nearby stars that possess extended debris disks whose structures suggest the presence of perturbing planetary objects With its high sensitivity and stable point spread function Spitzer/IRAC is uniquely capable of detecting cool Jupiter-like planetary companions whose peak emission is predicted to occur near 4
We report on deep IRAC imaging of these two stars taken at 3 6 and 4 5 um using subarray mode and in all four channels in wider-field full array mode Observations acquired at two different telescope roll angles allowed faint surrounding objects to be separated from the stellar diffraction pattern
No companion candidates were detected at the reported position of Fomalhaut b with 3 sigma model-dependent mass upper limits of 3 MJ (for an age of 200 Myr) Around epsilon Eridani we instead set a limit of 4 and &lt;1 MJ (1 Gyr model age) at the inner and outer edge of the sub-millimeter debris ring
The detection and characterization of Earth-like planet is approaching rapidly thanks to radial velocity surveys (HARPS) transit searches (Corot Kepler) and space observatories dedicated to their characterization are already in development phase (James Webb Space Telescope) large ground based telescopes (ELT TNT GMT) and dedicated space-based missions like Darwin Terrestrial Planet Finder
New World Observer) In this paper we discuss how we can read a planets spectrum to assess its habitability and search for the signatures of a biosphere Identifying signs of life implies understanding how the observed atmosphere physically and chemically works and thus to gather information on the planet in addition to the observing its spectral fingerprint
The origin of the Martian moons Deimos and Phobos is controversial One hypothesis for their origin is that they are captured asteroids but the mechanism requires an extremely dense martian atmosphere and the mechanism by which an asteroid in solar orbit could shed sufficient orbital energy to be captured into Mars orbit has not been well elucidated
Since the discovery by the space probe Galileo that the asteroid Ida has a moon &#34;Dactyl&#34; a significant number of asteroids have been discovered to have smaller asteroids in orbit about them The existence of asteroid moons provides a mechanism for the capture of the Martian moons (and the small moons of the outer planets)
When a binary asteroid makes a close approach to a planet tidal forces can strip the moon from the asteroid Depending on the phasing the asteroid can then be captured Clearly the same process can be used to explain the origin of any of the small moons in the solar system
We report here the discovery of the first planet around an ultracool dwarf star It is also the first extrasolar giant planet (EGP) astrometrically discovered around a main-sequence star The statistical significance of the detection is shown in two ways First there is a 2 x 10^-8 probability that the astrometric motion fits a parallax-and-proper-motion-only model
Second periodogram analysis shows a false alarm probability of 3 x 10^-5 that the discovered period is randomly generated The planetary mass is M2 = 6 4 (+2 6 -3 1) Jupiter-masses (MJ) and the orbital period is P = 0 744 (+0 013 -0 008) yr in the most likely model
In less likely models companion masses that are higher than the 13 MJ planetary mass limit are ruled out by past radial velocity measurements unless the system radial velocity is more than twice the current upper limits and the near-periastron orbital phase was never observed This new planetary system is remarkable
in part because its star VB 10 is near the lower mass limit for a star Our astrometric observations provide a dynamical mass measurement and will in time allow us to confront the theoretical models of formation and evolution of such systems and their members We thus add to the diversity of planetary systems and to the small number of known M-dwarf planets
The origin of the regular satellites ties directly to planetary formation in that the satellites form in gas and dust disks around the giant planets and may be viewed as mini-solar systems involving a number of closely related underlying physical processes The regular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn share a number of remarkable similarities that taken together make a compelling case for a deep-seated order and structure governing their origin
Furthermore the similarities in the mass ratio of the largest satellites to their primaries the specific angular momenta and the bulk compositions of the two satellite systems are significant and in need of explanation Yet the differences are also striking We advance a common framework for the origin of the regular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn and discuss the accretion of satellites in gaseous
circumplanetary disks Following giant planet formation planetesimals in the planet&#39;s feeding zone undergo a brief period of intense collisional grinding Mass delivery to the circumplanetary disk via ablation of planetesimal fragments has implications for a host of satellite observations tying the history of planetesimals to that of satellitesimals and ultimately that of the satellites themselves
We study a simple magnetohydrodynamical approach in which hydrodynamics and MHD turbulence are coupled in a shell model with given dynamo constrains in the large scales We consider the case of a low Prandtl number fluid for which the inertial range of the velocity field is much wider than that of the magnetic field
Using precise relative astrometry from the Hubble Space Telescope and the W M Keck Telescope we have determined the orbits and masses of the two dynamically interacting satellites of the dwarf planet (136108) Haumea formerly 2003 EL61 The orbital parameters of Hi&#39;iaka the outer brighter satellite match well the previously derived orbit
On timescales longer than a few weeks no Keplerian orbit is sufficient to describe the motion of the inner fainter satellite Namaka Using a fully-interacting three point-mass model we have recovered the orbital parameters of both orbits and the mass of Haumea and Hi&#39;iaka; Namaka&#39;s mass is marginally detected The data are not sufficient to uniquely determine the gravitational quadrupole of the non-spherical primary (described by $J_2$)
The nearly co-planar nature of the satellites as well as an inferred density similar to water ice strengthen the hypothesis that Haumea experienced a giant collision billions of years ago The excited eccentricities and mutual inclination point to an intriguing tidal history of significant semi-major axis evolution through satellite mean-motion resonances
Jupiter family comet 17P/Holmes underwent a remarkable outburst on UT 2007 Oct 24 in which the integrated brightness abruptly increased by about a factor of a <a href="http //million We" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> obtained near infrared (0 8 - 4 2 micron) spectra of 17P/Holmes on UT 2007 Oct
using the 3 0-m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) atop Mauna Kea Two broad absorption bands were found in the reflectance spectra with centers (at 2 micron and 3 micron respectively) and overall shapes consistent with the presence of water ice grains in the coma Synthetic mixing models of these bands suggest an origin in cold ice grains of micron size
Curiously though the expected 1 5 micron band of water ice was not detected in our data an observation for which we have no explanation Simultaneously excess thermal emission in the spectra at wavelengths beyond 3 2 micron has a color temperature of 360 +/- 40 K (corresponding to a superheat factor of ~ 2
This is too hot for these grains to be icy The detection of both water ice spectral features and short-wavelength thermal emission suggests that the coma of 17P/Holmes has two components (hot refractory dust and cold ice grains) which are not in thermal contact A similarity to grains ejected into the coma of 9P/Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact spacecraft is noted
We present follow-up observations of comet 17/P Holmes after its extreme outburst in brightness which occurred end of October 2007 We obtained 58 V-band images of the comet between October 2007 and February 2008 using the Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera (CTK) at the University Observatory Jena We present precise astrometry of the comet
which yields its most recent Keplerian orbital elements Furthermore we show that the comet&#39;s coma expands quite linearly with a velocity of about 1650km/s between October and December 2007 The photometric monitoring of comet 17/P Holmes shows that its photometric activity level decreased by about 5 9mag within 105 days after its outburst
Searching for life in the universe will make use of several large space missions in the visible and thermal infrared each with increasing spectral and angular resolution They will require long-term planning over the coming decades We present the necessity for building an international structure to coordinate activities for the next several decades and sketch the possible structure and role of a dedicated international institution
We present an improved measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the exoplanetary system HD 17156 based on radial-velocity data gathered with the Subaru 8 2m telescope throughout the planetary transit of UT 2008 November 7 The data allow for a precise and independent determination of the projected spin-orbit angle of this system
$\lambda = 10 0^{\circ} \pm 5 1^{\circ}$ This result supersedes the previous claim of $\lambda = 62^{\circ} \pm 25^{\circ}$ by Narita et al which was based on lower-precision data with poor statistics Thus the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes of the HD 17156 system are likely to be well-aligned
Stellar astrospheres--the plasma cocoons carved out of the interstellar medium by stellar winds--are continually influenced by their passage through the fluctuating interstellar medium (ISM) Inside dense interstellar regions an astrosphere may be compressed to a size smaller than the liquid-water habitable zone distance Habitable planets then enjoy no astrospheric buffering from the full flux of Galactic cosmic rays and interstellar dust and gas
a situation we call ``descreening &#39;&#39; Recent papers (Yeghikyan and Fahr Pavlov et al ) have suggested such global consequences as severe ozone depletion and glaciation Using a ram-pressure balance model that includes gravitational focusing of the interstellar flow we compute the size of the astrosphere in the apex direction as a function of parent star mass
We derive a dependence on the parent-star mass M due to gravitational focusing for densities larger than about 100 (M/M_\odot)^{-2} cm^{-3} We calculate the interstellar densities required to descreen planets in the habitable zone of solar- and subsolar-mass stars and find a critical descreening density of roughly 600 (M/M_\odot)^{-2} cm^{-3} for the Sun&#39;s velocity relative to the local ISM
Finally we estimate from ISM observations the frequency of descreening encounters as 1--10 Gyr^{-1} for solar-type stars and 10^2--10^9 times smaller for M stars Given this disparity we conclude that M star habitable-zone planets are virtually never exposed to the severe effects discussed by Yeghikyan and Fahr and Pavlov et al
Just fourteen years ago the Solar System represented the only known planetary system in the Galaxy and conceptions of planet formation were shaped by this sample of one Since then 320 planets have been discovered orbiting 276 individual stars This large and growing ensemble of exoplanets has informed theories of planet formation
placed the Solar System in a broader context and revealed many surprises along the way In this review I provide an overview of what has been learned from studies of the occurrence orbits and physical structures of planets After taking a look back at how far the field has advanced
We discuss the DISORT-based radiative transfer pipeline (&#39;CRISM_LambertAlb&#39;) for atmospheric and thermal correction of MRO/CRISM data acquired in multispectral mapping mode (~200 m/pixel 72 spectral channels) Currently in this phase-one version of the system we use aerosol optical depths surface temperatures and lower-atmospheric temperatures all from climatology derived from Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS-TES) data
and surface altimetry derived from MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) The DISORT-based model takes as input the dust and ice aerosol optical depths (scaled to the CRISM wavelength range) the surface pressures (computed from MOLA altimetry MGS-TES lower-atmospheric thermometry and Viking-based pressure climatology) the surface temperatures the reconstructed instrumental photometric angles
and the measured I/F spectrum and then outputs a Lambertian albedo spectrum The Lambertian albedo spectrum is valuable geologically since it allows the mineralogical composition to be estimated Here I/F is defined as the ratio of the radiance measured by CRISM to the solar irradiance at Mars divided by $\pi$
After discussing the capabilities and limitations of the pipeline software system we demonstrate its application on several multispectral data cubes the outer northern ice cap of Mars Tyrrhena Terra and near the landing site for the Phoenix mission For the icy spectra near the northern polar cap aerosols need to be included in order to properly correct for the CO_2 absorption in the H_{2}O ice bands at wavelengths near 2
Doppler and transit surveys are finding extrasolar planets of ever smaller mass and radius and are now sampling the domain of superEarths (1-3 Earth radii) Recent results from the Doppler surveys suggest that discovery of a transiting superEarth in the habitable zone of a lower main sequence star may be possible
We evaluate the prospects for an all-sky transit survey targeted to the brightest stars that would find the most favorable cases for photometric and spectroscopic characterization using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) We use the proposed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as representative of an all-sky survey We couple the simulated TESS yield to a sensitivity model for the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments on JWST
We focus on the TESS planets with radii between Earth and Neptune Our simulations consider secondary eclipse filter photometry using JWST/MIRI comparing the 11- and 15-micron bands to measure CO2 absorption in superEarths as well as JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of water absorption from 1 7-3 0 microns and CO2 absorption at 4
We project that TESS will discover about eight nearby habitable transiting superEarths The principal sources of uncertainty in the prospects for JWST characterization of habitable superEarths are superEarth frequency and the nature of superEarth atmospheres Based on our estimates of these uncertainties we project that JWST will be able to measure the temperature
I review constraints on solar system-bound dark matter and discuss the possibility that dark matter could be gravitationally bound to the earth and other planets I briefly survey various empirical constraints on such planet-bound dark matter and discuss effects it could produce if present including anomalous planetary heating and flyby velocity changes
We present thermal observations of 44 Jovian Trojan asteroids with diameters (D) ranging from 5 to 24 km All objects were observed at a wavelength of 24 microns with the Spitzer Space Telescope Measurements of the thermal emission and of scattered optical light mostly from the University of Hawaii 2
together allow us to constrain the diameter and geometric albedo of each body We find that the median R-band albedo of these small Jovian Trojans is about 0 12 much higher than that of &#34;large&#34; Trojans with D &gt; 57 km (0 04) Also the range of albedos among the small Trojans is wider
We attribute the Trojan albedos to an evolutionary effect the small Trojans are more likely to be collisional fragments and so their surfaces would be younger A younger surface means less cumulative exposure to the space environment which suggests that their surfaces would not be as dark as those of the large
We model the formation of silicate atmospheres on hot volatile-free super-Earths Our calculations assume that all volatile elements such as H C N S and Cl have been lost from the planet We find that the atmospheres are composed primarily of Na O2 O and SiO gas in order of decreasing abundance
The atmospheric composition may be altered by fractional vaporization cloud condensation photoionization and reaction with any residual volatile elements remaining in the atmosphere Cloud condensation reduces the abundance of all elements in the atmosphere except Na and K We speculate that large Na and K clouds such as those observed around Mercury and Io may surround hot super-Earths
Numerical simulations of planets embedded in protoplanetary gaseous discs are a precious tool for studying the planetary migration ; however some approximations have to be made Most often the selfgravity of the gas is neglected In that case it is not clear in the literature how the material inside the Roche lobe of the planet should be taken into account
Here we want to address this issue by studying the influence of various methods so far used by different authors on the migration rate <br>We performed high-resolution numerical simulations of giant planets embedded in discs We compared the migration rates with and without gas selfgravity testing various ways of taking the circum-planetary disc (CPD) into account
Different methods lead to significantly different migration rates Adding the mass of the CPD to the perturbing mass of the planet accelerates the migration Excluding a part of the Hill sphere is a very touchy parameter that may lead to an artificial suppression of the type III runaway migration In fact
the CPD is smaller than the Hill sphere We recommend excluding no more than a 0 6 Hill radius and using a smooth filter Alternatively the CPD can be given the acceleration felt by the planet from the rest of the protoplanetary disc <br>The gas inside the Roche lobe of the planet should be very carefully taken into account in numerical simulations without any selfgravity of the gas
We calculate simulated images of disks perturbed by embedded small planets These 10-50 M_Earth bodies represent the growing cores of giant planets We examine scattered light and thermal emission from these disks over a range of wavelengths taking into account the wavelength-dependent opacity of dust in the disk We also examine the effect of inclination on the observed perturbations
We find that the perturbations are best observed in the visible to mid-infrared Scattered light images reflect shadows produced at the surface of perturbed disks while the infrared images follow thermal emission from the surface of the disk showing cooled/heated material in the shadowed/brightened regions At still longer wavelengths in the sub-millimeter
the perturbation fades as the disk becomes optically thin and surface features become overwhelmed by emission closer toward the midplane of the disk With the construction of telescopes such as TMT GMT and ALMA due in the next decade there is a real possibility of observing planets forming in disks in the optical and sub-millimeter
Using very high resolution (lambda / Dlambda ~ 95000) 4 7 micron fundamental and 2 3 micron overtone ro-vibrational CO absorption spectra obtained with the CRIRES infrared spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) we report detections of four CO isotopologues -- C16O 13CO C18O and the rare species C17O -- in the circumstellar environment of two young protostars
VV CrA and Reipurth 50 We argue that the observed CO absorption lines probe a protoplanetary disk in VV CrA and a protostellar envelope in Reipurth 50 All CO line profiles are spectrally resolved permitting direct calculation of CO oxygen isotopologue ratios with 5-10% accuracy The ro-vibrational level populations for all species can be reproduced by assuming that CO absorption arises in two temperature regimes
For both objects 12C/13C are on the order of 100 nearly twice the expected interstellar medium (ISM) ratio The derived oxygen abundance ratios for the VV CrA disk show a significant mass-independent deficit of C17O and C18O relative to C16O compared to ISM baseline abundances The Reipurth 50 envelope shows no clear differences in oxygen CO isotopologue ratios compared with the local ISM
A mass-independent fractionation can be interpreted as being due to selective photodissociation of CO in the disk surface due to self-shielding The deficits in C17O$ and C18O$ in the VV CrA protoplanetary disk are consistent with an analogous origin of the 16O variability in the solar system by isotope selective photodissociation
The reason for the horizontal turn of the Tunguska-1908 bolide trajectory remains difficult to understand It finds explanation however in the New Explosive Cosmogony of minor bodies as having been caused by an explosion of a part (M up to 10^12 g) of the comet nucleus whose ices contained products of its electrolysis
In detonation this part was repelled from the more massive unexploded nucleus remnant changed the direction of its own motion by ~10^o and imparted its kinetic energy in expanding and slowing down to the air in producing an effect of a high-altitude explosion Because there are no traces of a fall of the more massive remnant
one comes to the conclusion that on passing through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere it again entered a heliocentric orbit (the hypothesis of <a href="http //V Vernadskiy" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> 1932) A search for this comet P/Tunguska-1908 among the 6077 known NEAs shows the 2005NB56 object to be the most appropriate candidate for a number of its parameters (a size is ~ 170 m
P = 2 106 y e = 0 473 and i = 6 8^o) Back integration of its orbit made without allowing for non-gravitational effects suggests that it had passed the Earth on June 27 1908 at a distance of 0 06945 AU It is quite possible that a proper inclusion of even fairly weak non-gravitational forces would make its orbit fit in parameters that of the Tunguska bolide
We present a systematic survey for satellites of Venus using the Baade-Magellan 6 5 meter telescope and IMACS wide-field CCD imager at Las Campanas observatory in Chile In the outer portions of the Hill sphere the search was sensitive to a limiting red magnitude of about 20 4 which corresponds to satellites with radii of a few hundred meters when assuming an albedo of 0
Of the 342 planets discovered so far orbiting other stars 58 &#34;transit&#34; the stellar disk meaning that they can be detected by a periodic decrease in the starlight flux The light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet and in a few cases the basic atmospheric composition of the planet can be estimated
As we get closer to finding analogues of Earth an important consideration toward the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres is what the transmission spectrum of our planet looks like Here we report the optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth obtained during a lunar eclipse Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in the reflected spectrum (such as ozone
The well-known Tunguska-1908 phenomenon (TP) problems (the fast transfer of the kinetic energy of the meteoroid W~10-50 Mt TNT to air with its heating to T&gt;10^4 K at an altitude of 5-10 km the final turn of the smoothly sloping ~0-20^o to horizon trajectory of the body through ~10^o to the West
the pattern and area of the tree-fall and trees&#39; scorching by heat radiation etc ) allow a simple solution within the New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of minor bodies as opposed to other approaches The NEC considers the short-period (SP) comet nuclei to which the Tunguska body belonged to be fragments produced in explosions of massive icy envelopes of Ganymede-type bodies saturated by products of bulk electrolysis of ices to the form of a 2H2+O2 solid solution
The nearly tangent entry into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere with V~20 km/s of such a nucleus ~200-500 m in size and ~(5-50)x10^12 g in mass also saturated by 2H2+O2 initiated detonation of its part of ~10^12 g at an altitude of 5-10 km This resulted in deflection of this fraction trajectory by 5^o-10^o
and fast expansion with ~2 km/s of its detonation products brought about their fast slowing down by the air heating of the latter to T&gt;10^4 K and a phenomenon of high-altitude explosion On crossing the Earth&#39;s atmosphere the main part of the unexploded nucleus escaped into space and this body moving presently in an SP orbit should eventually be identified in time
Its impact with W~250-3000 Mt TNT on the Earth&#39;s surface (which could occur in 1908) would have produced a crater up to ~3 5-8 km in size with an ejection of dust that would have brought about a climatic catastrophe The processes involved in the TP are resembling those accompanying falling P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 onto Jupiter and
For the past 3 years we have been monitoring 62 K giant stars using precise stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with the 2m Alfred Jensch telescope of the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg (TLS) To probe the dependence of planet formation on stellar mass by finding planets around intermediate-mass giant stars We present high accuracy RV measurements of the K1
The wavelength reference for the RV measurements was provided by an iodine absorption cell placed in the optical path of the spectrograph Our measurements reveal that the time series of the radial velocity of 42 Dra shows a periodic variation of 479 1 days HD 139357 shows periodic RV variations of 1125
We investigate the formation of terrestrial planets in the late stage of planetary formation using two-planet model At that time the protostar has formed for about 3 Myr and the gas disk has dissipated In the model the perturbations from Jupiter and Saturn are considered We also consider variations of the mass of outer planet
and the initial eccentricities and inclinations of embryos and planetesimals Our results show that terrestrial planets are formed in 50 Myr and the accretion rate is about $60% - 80%$ In each simulation 3 - 4 terrestrial planets are formed inside &#34;Jupiter&#34; with masses of $0 15 - 3 6 M_{\oplus}$
In the $0 5 - 4$ AU when the eccentricities of planetesimals are excited planetesimals are able to accrete material from wide radial direction The plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet in the Habitable Zone may be transferred from the farther places by this mechanism Accretion could also happen a few times between two major planets only if the outer planet has a moderate mass and the small terrestrial planet could survive at some resonances over time scale of $10^8$ yr
The GJ 581 planetary system was already known to harbour three planets including two super-Earths planets which straddle its habitable zone We report here the detection of an additional planet -- GJ 581e -- with a minimum mass of 1 9 M_earth With a period of 3 15 days it is the innermost planet of the system and has a ~5% transit probability
We also correct our previous confusion of the orbital period of GJ 581d (the outermost planet) with a one-year alias thanks to an extended time span and many more measurements The revised period is 66 8 days and locates the semi-major axis inside the habitable zone of the low mass star
We conducted a search for occultations of bright stars by Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) to estimate the density of sub-km KBOs in the sky We report here the first results of this occultation survey of the outer solar system conducted in June 2007 and June/July 2008 at the MMT Observatory using Megacam
the large MMT optical imager We used Megacam in a novel shutterless continuous--readout mode to achieve high precision photometry at 200 Hz We present an analysis of 220 star hours at signal-to-noise ratio of 25 or greater The survey efficiency is greater than 10% for occultations by KBOs of diameter d&gt;=0
and we report no detections in our dataset We set a new 95% confidence level upper limit for the surface density \Sigma_N(d) of KBOs larger than 1 km \Sigma_N(d&gt;=1 km) &lt;= 2 0e8 deg^-2 and for KBOs larger than 0 7 km \Sigma_N(d&gt;= 0 7 km) &lt;= 4 8e8 deg^-2
In this review three major changes in our understanding of the early history of the Solar System are presented <br>1) Early differentiation A few recent results support the idea that protoplanet formation and differentiation occurred partly simultaneously than CAI formation First some iron meteorites eucrites and angrites older than the chondrules or even than the CAI have been found
Second iron meteorites could be debris of early disrupted differentiated planetesimals scattered from the terrestrial planet region to the Main Belt Finally chondrules contain fragments of planetesimal material <br>2) Earth and Moon An equilibration mechanism explains the identical Oxygen isotopic composition of the Earth and the Moon In addition it has been shown that the Earth and the Moon mantles have the same 182^W anomaly
in contrast to what was believed before Consequently the Moon forming impact should have occurred after the extinction of the 182Hf radioactivity about 60 Myr after Solar System formation This new datation is in agreement with new N-body numerical simulations of the last phase of terrestrial planets formation in which giant impacts occur during about 100 Myr
<br>3) Giant planets and Nice model The migration of the giant planets in the protoplanetary disc can be prevented if the planets are in resonance close to each other In the ``Nice model&#39;&#39; the 4 outer planets of the Solar System were in a compact configuration after the dissipation of gaseous disc
We present a high angular resolution (0 3&#34; = 40 AU) SMA survey of the 870 micron thermal continuum emission from 9 of the brightest and therefore most massive circumstellar disks in the ~1 Myr-old Ophiuchus star-forming region Using 2-D radiative transfer calculations we simultaneously fit the observed continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk with a parametric structure model
Compared to previous millimeter studies this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling data quality and angular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structure parameters particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution of mass in the disks In the context of a surface density profile motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks
the best-fit models for the sample disks have characteristic radii R_c = 20-200 AU high disk masses M_d = 0 005-0 14 M_sun and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients around a median $\gamma$ = 0 9 These density structures are used in conjunction with accretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscous evolution of the disk material
Using the standard prescription for disk viscosities those combined constraints indicate that $\alpha$ = 0 0005-0 08 Three of the sample disks show large (R = 20-40 AU) central cavities in their continuum emission morphologies marking extensive zones where dust has been physically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities Based on the current requirements of planet formation models
We present analysis of the asteroid surface density distribution of main belt asteroids (mean perihelion $\Delta \simeq 2 404$ AU) in five ecliptic latitude fields $-17 \gtsimeq \beta(\degr) \ltsimeq +15$ derived from deep \textit{Large Binocular Telescope} (LBT) $V-$band (85% completeness limit $V = 21 3$ mag) and \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} IRAC 8
We discovered 58 new asteroids in the optical survey as well as 41 new bodies in the \textit{Spitzer} fields The derived power law slopes of the number of asteroids per square degree are similar within each $\sim 5$\degr{} ecliptic latitude bin with a mean value of $ -0 111 \pm 0
For the 23 known asteroids detected in all four IRAC channels mean albedos range from $0 24 \pm 0 07$ to $0 10 \pm 0 05$ No low albedo asteroids ($p_{V}$ $\ltsimeq$ 0 1) were detected in the \textit{Spitzer} FLS fields whereas in the SWIRE fields they are frequent The SWIRE data clearly samples asteroids in the middle and outer belts providing the first estimates of these km-sized asteroids&#39; albedos
Our observed asteroid number densities at optical wavelengths are generally consistent with those derived from the Standard Asteroid Model within the ecliptic plane However we find an over density at $\beta \gtsimeq 5$\degr{} in our optical fields while the infrared number densities are under dense by factors of 2 to 3 at all ecliptic latitudes
We present results from a search for additional transiting planets in 24 systems already known to contain a transiting planet We model the transits due to the known planet in each system and subtract these models from lightcurves obtained with the SuperWASP survey instruments These residual lightcurves are then searched for evidence of additional periodic transit events
Although we do not find any evidence for additional planets in any of the planetary systems studied we are able to characterise our ability to find such planets by means of Monte Carlo simulations Artificially generated transit signals corresponding to planets with a range of sizes and orbital periods were injected into the SuperWASP photometry and the resulting lightcurves searched for planets
As a result the detection efficiency as a function of both the radius and orbital period of any second planet is calculated We determine that there is a good (&gt; 50 per cent) chance of detecting additional Saturn-sized planets in P ~ 10 d orbits around planet-hosting stars that have several seasons of SuperWASP photometry
We compute statistical properties of the lowest-order multipole coefficients of the magnetic field generated by a dynamo of arbitrary shape To this end we expand the field in a complete biorthogonal set of base functions viz B = sum_k a^k(t) b^k(r) We consider a linear problem and the statistical properties of the fluid flow are supposed to be given
The turbulent convection may have an arbitrary distribution of spatial scales The time evolution of the expansion coefficients a^k(t) is governed by a stochastic differential equation from which we infer their averages &lt;a^k&gt; autocorrelation functions &lt;a^k(t) a^{k*}(t+tau)&gt; and an equation for the cross correlations &lt;a^k a^l*&gt; The eigenfunctions of the dynamo equation (with eigenvalues lambda_k) turn out to be a preferred set in terms of which our results assume their simplest form
The magnetic field of the dynamo is shown to consist of transiently excited eigenmodes whose frequency and coherence time is given by Im(lambda_k) and -1/(Re lambda_k) respectively The relative r m s excitation level of the eigenmodes and hence the distribution of magnetic energy over spatial scales is determined by linear theory
An expression is derived for &lt;|a^k|^2&gt; / &lt;|a^0|^2&gt; in case the fundamental mode b^0 has a dominant amplitude and we outline how this expression may be evaluated It is estimated that &lt;|a^k|^2&gt;/&lt;|a^0|^2&gt; ~ 1/N where N is the number of convective cells in the dynamo We show that the old problem of a short correlation time (or FOSA) has been partially eliminated
Water methane and carbon-monoxide are expected to be among the most abundant molecules besides molecular hydrogen in the hot atmosphere of close-in EGPs Transit observations in the mid-IR allow the atmospheric content of transiting planets to be determined We present new primary transit observations of the hot-jupiter HD189733b obtained simultaneously at 4
Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3 6 and 5 8 micron using the same instrument we are able to derive the system parameters including planet-to-star radius ratio impact parameter scale of the system and central time of the transit from fits of the transit light curves at these four wavelengths
We measure the four planet-to-star radius ratios to be (R_p/R_*)= 0 1545 +/- 0 0003 0 1557 +/- 0 0003 0 1547 +/- 0 0005 0 1544 +/- 0 0004 at 3 6 4 5 5 8 and 8 micron respectively The high accuracy of the measurement allows the search for atmospheric molecular absorbers
Contrary to a previous analysis of the same dataset our study is robust against systematics and reveals that water vapor absorption at 5 8 micron is not detected in this photometric dataset Furthermore in the band centered around 4 5 micron we find a hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius Delta(R_p/R_*) = 0
This value is 4 sigma above what would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only absorbing species in the near infrared This shows that an additional species absorbing around 4 5 micron could be present in the atmosphere CO being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H2O ratio between 5 and 60
We present a study of the light curve of the transiting exoplanet CoRoT-2b aimed at detecting the secondary eclipse and measuring its depth The data were obtained with the CoRoT satellite during its first run of more than 140 days After filtering the low frequencies with a pre-whitening technique we detect a 0
Assuming a black-body emission of the planet we estimate a surface brightness temperature of T$_{\rm p CoRoT}$=1910$^{+90}_{-100}$ K We provide the planet&#39;s equilibrium temperature and re-distribution factors as a function of the unknown amount of reflected light The upper limit for the geometric albedo is 0 12 The detected secondary is the shallowest ever found
We report a sensitive search for meter-wavelength emission at 244 and 614 MHz from HD189733b the nearest known extrasolar transiting planet of `hot-Jupiter&#39; type To discriminate any planetary emission from possible stellar or background contributions we observed the system for 7 7 hours encompassing the planet&#39;s eclipse behind the host star
These GMRT observations provide very low (3 sigma) upper limits of 2 mJy at 244 MHz and 160 micro-Jy at 614 MHz These limits are respectively about 40 and 500 times deeper than those reported recently at a nearby frequency of 340 MHz Possible explanations of our non-detection include (1) the Earth being outside the planet&#39;s emission beam; (2) its highly variable emission with more rapid flaring than the temporal sampling in our observations; (3) the planetary emission being intrinsically too weak; or more likely
We present the results of our Thousand Asteroid Light Curve Survey (TALCS) conducted with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in September 2006 Our untargeted survey detected 828 Main Belt asteroids to a limiting magnitude of g&#39;~22 5 corresponding to a diameter range of 0 4 km &lt;= D &lt;= 10 km Of these
We debiased the observations and light curve fitting process to determine the true distribution of rotation periods and light curve amplitudes of Main Belt asteroids We confirm a previously reported excess in the fraction of fast rotators but find a much larger excess of slow rotating asteroids (~15% of our sample)
A few percent of objects in the TALCS size range have large light curve amplitudes of ~1 mag Fits to the debiased distribution of light curve amplitudes indicate that the distribution of triaxial ellipsoid asteroid shapes is proportional to the square of the axis-ratio (b/a)^2 and may be bi-modal Finally
we find six objects with rotation periods that may be less than 2 hours with diameters between 400 m and 1 5 km well above the break-up limit for a gravitationally-bound aggregate Our debiased data indicate that this population represents &lt;4% of the Main Belt in the 1-10 km size range
Titan the largest satellite of Saturn has an atmosphere chiefly made up of N2 and CH4 and includes traces of many simple organic compounds This atmosphere also partly consists of haze and aerosol particles which during the last 4 5 gigayears have been processed by electric discharges ions and ionizing photons
being slowly deposited over the Titan surface In this work we investigate the possible effects produced by soft X-rays (and secondary electrons) on Titan aerosol analogs in an attempt to simulate some prebiotic photochemistry The experiments have been performed inside a high vacuum chamber coupled to the soft X-ray spectroscopy beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source
Campinas Brazil In-situ sample analyses were performed by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer The infrared spectra have presented several organic molecules including nitriles and aromatic CN compounds After the irradiation the brownish-orange organic residue (tholin) was analyzed ex-situ by gas chromatographic (GC/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) techniques revealing the presence of adenine (C5H5N5)
one of the constituents of the DNA molecule This confirms previous results which showed that the organic chemistry on the Titan surface can be very complex and extremely rich in prebiotic compounds Molecules like these on the early Earth have found a place to allow life (as we know) to flourish
I review the current capabilities of small medium and large telescopes in the study of minor bodies of the Solar System (MBOSS) with the goal of identifying those areas where the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are required to progress This also leads to a discussion of the synergies between large and small telescopes
It is clear that the new facilities that will become available in the next decades will allow us to discover smaller and more distant objects (completing size distributions) and to characterise and even resolve larger individual bodies and multiple systems however we must also recognise that there is still much to be learned from wide surveys that require more time on more telescopes than can ever be available on ELTs
The habitable zones of main sequence stars have traditionally been defined as the range of orbits that intercept the appropriate amount of stellar flux to permit surface water on a planet Terrestrial exoplanets discovered to orbit M stars in these zones which are close-in due to decreased stellar luminosity may also undergo significant tidal heating
Tidal heating may span a wide range for terrestrial exoplanets and may significantly affect conditions near the surface For example if heating rates on an exoplanet are near or greater than that on Io (where tides drive volcanism that resurface the planet at least every 1 Myr) and produce similar surface conditions
then the development of life seems unlikely On the other hand if the tidal heating rate is less than the minimum to initiate plate tectonics then CO_2 may not be recycled through subduction leading to a runaway greenhouse that sterilizes the planet These two cases represent potential boundaries to habitability and are presented along with the range of the traditional habitable zone for main sequence
We study the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere to derive detectable features in low resolution of different global geochemical cycles on exoplanets - using the sulphur cycle as our example We derive low resolution detectable features for first generation space- and ground- based telescopes as a first step in comparative planetology
We assume that the surfaces and atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets (Earth-like and super-Earths) will most often be dominated by a specific geochemical cycle Here we concentrate on the sulphur cycle driven by outgassing of SO2 and H2S followed by their transformation to other sulphur-bearing species which is clearly distinguishable from the carbon cycle which is driven by outgassing of CO2
Due to increased volcanism the sulphur cycle is potentially the dominant global geochemical cycle on dry super-Earths with active tectonics We calculate planetary emission reflection and transmission spectrum from 0 4 to 40 micrometer with high and low resolution to assess detectable features using current and Archean Earth models with varying SO2 and H2S concentrations to explore reducing and oxidizing habitable environments on rocky planets
We find specific spectral signatures that are observable with low resolution in a planetary atmosphere with high SO2 and H2S concentration Therefore first generation space and ground based telescopes can test our understanding of geochemical cycles on rocky planets and potentially distinguish planetary environments dominated by the carbon and sulphur cycle
We perform numerical simulations to study the Habitable zones (HZs) and dynamical structure for Earth-mass planets in multiple planetary systems For example in the HD 69830 system we extensively explore the planetary configuration of three Neptune-mass companions with one massive terrestrial planet residing in 0 07 AU $\leq a \leq$ 1
to examine the asteroid structure in this system We underline that there are stable zones of at least $10^5$ yr for low-mass terrestrial planets locating between 0 3 and 0 5 AU and 0 8 and 1 2 AU with final eccentricities of $e &lt; 0 20$ Moreover we also find that the accumulation or depletion of the asteroid belt are also shaped by orbital resonances of the outer planets
for example the asteroidal gaps at 2 1 and 3 2 mean motion resonances (MMRs) with Planet C and 5 2 and 1 2 MMRs with Planet D In a dynamical sense the proper candidate regions for the existence of the potential terrestrial planets or HZs are 0 35 AU $&lt; a &lt; $ 0
We investigate an in-situ formation scenario for Earth-mass terrestrial planets in short-period potentially habitable orbits around low-mass stars (M_star &lt; 0 3 M_sun) We then investigate the feasibility of detecting these Earth-sized planets Our simulations of terrestrial planet formation follow the growth of planetary embryos in an annular region around a fiducial M7 primary
Our simulations couple a semi-analytic model to a full N-body integration to follow the growth from ~3x10^21 g to the final planetary system configurations that generally consist of 3-5 planets with masses of order 0 1 - 1 0 M_earth in or near the habitable zone of the star To obtain a concrete estimate of the detectability of the planets arising in our simulations
we present a detailed Monte-Carlo transit detection simulation We find that detection of 1 R_earth planets around the local M-dwarfs is challenging for a 1m class ground-based photometric search but that detection of planets of larger radius is a distinct possibility The detection of Earth-sized planets is straightforward however with an all-sky survey by a low-cost satellite mission
Given a reduced correlated noise level of 0 45 mmag and an intermediate planetary ice-mass fraction of planets orbiting a target list drawn from the nearest late-type M dwarfs a ground-based photometric search could detect on average 0 8 of these planets with an extended search A space-based photometric search (similar to the TESS mission) should discover ~17 of these Earth-sized planets during it&#39;s two year survey
Recently the first collisional family was discovered in the Kuiper belt The parent body of this family Haumea is one of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt and is orbited by two satellites It has been proposed that the Haumea family was created from dispersed fragments that resulted from a giant impact
This proposed origin of the Haumea family is however in conflict with the observed velocity dispersion between the family members (\sim 140 m/s) which is significantly less than the escape velocity from Haumea&#39;s surface (\sim 900 m/s) In this paper we propose a different formation scenario for Haumea&#39;s collisional family
In our scenario the family members are ejected while in orbit around Haumea This scenario therefore gives naturally rise to a lower velocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection from Haumea&#39;s surface In our scenario Haumea&#39;s giant impact forms a single moon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision from which the family is created
We show that this formation scenario yields a velocity dispersion of \sim 190m/s among the family members which is in good agreement with the observations The probability for Haumea&#39;s initial giant impact in todays Kuiper belt is less than 10^{-3} In our scenario however Haumea&#39;s giant impact can occur before the excitation of the Kuiper belt and the ejection of the family members afterwards
The observations of Mars by the CRISM and OMEGA hyperspectral imaging spectrometers require correction for photometric atmospheric and thermal effects prior to the interpretation of possible mineralogical features in the spectra Here we report on a simple yet non-trivial adaptation to the commonly-used volcano-scan correction technique for atmospheric CO_2 which allows for the improved detection of minerals with intrinsic absorption bands at wavelengths between 1
This volcano-scan technique removes the absorption bands of CO_2 by ensuring that the Lambert albedo is the same at two wavelengths 1 890 $\mu$m and 2 011 $\mu$m with the first wavelength outside the CO_2 gas bands and the second wavelength deep inside the CO_2 gas bands Our adaptation to the volcano-scan technique moves the first wavelength from 1
(Abridged) The observed radial velocity (RV) eccentricity distribution for extrasolar planets in single-planet systems shows that a significant fraction of planets are eccentric ($e &gt; 0 1$) Here we investigate the effects on an RV planet&#39;s eccentricity produced by undetected outer companions We have carried out Monte Carlo simulations of mock RV data to understand this effect and predict its impact on the observed distribution
We first quantify the statistical effect of undetected outer companions and show that this alone cannot explain the observed distribution We then modify the simulations to consist of two populations one of zero-eccentricity planets in double-planet systems and the other of single planets drawn from an eccentric distribution Our simulations show that a good fit to the observed distribution is obtained with 45% zero-eccentricity double-planets and 55% single eccentric planets
Matching the observed distribution allows us to determine the probability that a known RV planet&#39;s orbital eccentricity has been biased by an undetected wide-separation companion Our simulations show that moderately-eccentric planets with $0 1 &lt; e &lt; 0 3$ and $0 1 &lt; e &lt; 0 2$ have a $\sim 13%$ and $\sim 19%$ probability
It has long been assumed that the planet Jupiter acts as a giant shield significantly lowering the impact rate of minor bodies upon the Earth and thus enabling the development and evolution of life in a collisional environment which is not overly hostile However in the past little work has been carried out to examine the validity of this idea
In the second of a series of papers we examine the degree to which the impact risk resulting from objects on Centaur-like orbits is affected by the presence of a giant planet in a continuing attempt to fully understand the impact regime under which life on Earth has developed The Centaurs
which occupy orbits beyond Jupiter have their origins in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt that extends beyond Neptune The giant planets peturb the Centaurs sending a significanr fraction into the inner Solar System where they become visible as short-period comets In this work we present results which show that the presence of a giant planet can act to significantly change the impact rate of short-period comets on the Earth
We have used the Spitzer 22-um peakup array to observe thermal emission from the nucleus and trail of comet 103P/Hartley 2 the target of NASA&#39;s Deep Impact Extended mission The comet was observed on UT 2008 August 12 and 13 while the comet was 5 5 AU from the Sun
We obtained two 200-frame sets of photometric imaging over a 2 7-hour period To within the errors of the measurement we find no detection of any temporal variation between the two images The comet showed extended emission beyond a point source in the form of a faint trail directed along the comet&#39;s anti-velocity vector
After modeling and removing the trail emission a NEATM model for the nuclear emission with beaming parameter of 0 95 +/- 0 20 indicates a small effective radius for the nucleus of 0 57 +/- 0 08 km and low geometric albedo 0 028 +/- 0 009 (1 sigma) With this nucleus size and a water production rate of 3 x 10^28 molecules s-1 at perihelion (A&#39;Hearn et al
Reports of emission activity out to ~5 AU (Lowry et al 2001 Snodgrass et al 2008) support our finding of a highly active nuclear surface Compared to Deep Impact&#39;s first target comet 9P/Tempel 1 Hartley 2&#39;s nucleus is one-fifth as wide (and about one-hundredth the mass) while producing a similar amount of outgassing at perihelion with about 13 times the active surface fraction
Unlike Tempel 1 it should be highly susceptible to jet driven spin-up torques and so could be rotating at a much higher frequency Barring a catastrophic breakup or major fragmentation event the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700 yrs) at its current rate of mass loss
Asteroids are leftover pieces from the era of planet formation that help us understand conditions in the early Solar System Unlike larger planetary bodies that were subject to global thermal modification during and subsequent to their formation these small bodies have kept at least some unmodified primordial material from the solar nebula
However the structural properties of asteroids have been modified considerably since their formation Thus we can find among them a great variety of physical configurations and dynamical histories In fact with only a few possible exceptions all asteroids have been modified or completely disrupted many times during the age of the Solar System
This picture is supported by data from space mission encounters with asteroids that show much diversity of shape bulk density surface morphology and other features Moreover the gravitational attraction of these bodies is so small that some physical processes occur in a manner far removed from our common experience on Earth
Thus each visit to a small body has generated as many questions as it has answered In this review we discuss the current state of research into asteroid disruption processes focusing on collisional and rotational mechanisms We find that recent advances in modeling catastrophic disruption by collisions have provided important insights into asteroid internal structures and a deeper understanding of asteroid families
The gravitational interaction between a protoplanetary disc and planetary sized bodies that form within it leads to the exchange of angular momentum resulting in migration of the planets and possible gap formation in the disc for more massive planets In this article we review the basic theory of disc-planet interactions
and discuss the results of recent numerical simulations of planets embedded in protoplanetary discs We consider the migration of low mass planets and recent developments in our understanding of so-called type I migration when a fuller treatment of the disc thermodynamics is included We discuss the runaway migration of intermediate mass planets (so-called type III migration)
and the migration of giant planets (type II migration) and the associated gap formation in the disc The availability of high performance computing facilities has enabled global simulations of magnetised turbulent discs to be computed and we discuss recent results for both low and high mass planets embedded in such discs
The latest version of the planetary ephemerides developed at the Paris Observatory and at the Besancon Observatory is presented here INPOP08 is a 4-dimension ephemeris since it provides to users positions and velocities of planets and the relation between TT and TDB Investigations leading to improve the modeling of asteroids are described as well as the new sets of observations used for the fit of INPOP08
New observations provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) deduced from the tracking of the Mars Express (MEX) and Venus Express (VEX) missions are presented as well as the normal point deduced from the Cassini mission We show the huge impact brought by these observations in the fit of INPOP08
Since November 2002 we have conducted the largest deep imaging survey of the young nearby associations of the southern hemisphere Our goal is detection and characterization of substellar companions at intermediate (10--500 AU) physical separations We have observed a sample of 88 stars mostly G to M dwarfs that we essentially identify as younger than 100 Myr and closer to Earth than 100 pc
The VLT/NACO adaptive optics instrument of the ESO Paranal Observatory was used to explore the faint circumstellar environment between typically 0 1 and 10&#39;&#39; We report the discovery of 17 new close (0 1-5 0&#39;&#39;) multiple systems HIP108195AB and C (F1III-M6) HIP84642AB (a~14 AU K0-M5) and TWA22AB (a~1 8 AU; M6-M6) confirmed comoving systems
TWA22AB is likely to be a astrometric calibrator that can be used to test evolutionary predictions Among our complete sample a total of 65 targets observed with deep coronagraphic imaging About 240 faint candidates were detected around 36 stars Follow-up observations VLT or HST for 83% of these stars enabled us to identify a fraction of contaminants
The latest results about the substellar companions to GSC08047-00232 AB Pic and 2M1207 confirmed during this survey and published earlier are reviewed Finally the statistical analysis of our complete set of coronagraphic limits enables us to place constraints on the physical and properties of giant planets between typically 20 and 150 AU
We review the problem of the formation of terrestrial planets with particular emphasis on the interaction of dynamical and geochemical models The lifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a few million years based on astronomical observations while isotopic dating of meteorites and the Earth-Moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million years were required for the assembly of the Earth
Therefore much of the growth of the terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place under largely gas-free conditions and the physics of terrestrial planet formation is dominated by gravitational interactions and collisions The earliest phase of terrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or larger planetesimals from dust grains
followed by the accumulations of these planetesimals into ~100 lunar- to Mars-mass bodies that are initially gravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals but eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another The mutual perturbations between the embryos combined with gravitational stirring by Jupiter lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth to Earth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years
Numerical treatment of this process has focussed on the use of symplectic integrators which can rapidly integrate the thousands of gravitationally-interacting bodies necessary to accurately model planetary growth While the general nature of the terrestrial planets--their sizes and orbital parameters--seem to be broadly reproduced by the models there are still some outstanding dynamical issues
We report first results from the Anglo-Australian Telescope Rocky Planet Search - an intensive high-precision Doppler planet search targeting low-mass exoplanets in contiguous 48 night observing blocks On this run we targeted 24 bright nearby and intrinsically stable Sun-like stars selected from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search&#39;s main sample These observations have already detected one low-mass planet reported elsewhere (HD16417b)
and here we reconfirm the detection of HD4308b Further we have Monte-Carlo simulated the data from this run on a star-by-star basis to produce robust detection constraints These simulations demonstrate clear differences in the exoplanet detectability functions from star to star due to differences in sampling data quality and intrinsic stellar stability
They reinforce the importance of star-by-star simulation when interpreting the data from Doppler planet searches The simulations indicate that for some of our target stars we are sensitive to close-orbiting planets as small as a few Earth masses The two low-mass planets present in our 24 star sample indicate that the exoplanet minimum mass function at low masses is likely to be a flat alpha ~ -1 (for dN/dM proportional to M^alpha) and that between 15+/-10% (at alpha=-0
The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter but the region is not uniformly filled with asteroids There are gaps known as the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid distribution in distinct locations that are associated with orbital resonances with the giant planets; asteroids placed in these locations follow chaotic orbits and escape from the asteroid belt
Here we show that the observed distribution of main belt asteroids does not fill uniformly even those regions that are dynamically stable over the age of the solar system We find a pattern of excess depletion of asteroids particularly just outward of the Kirkwood Gaps associated with the 5 2
the 7 3 and the 2 1 jovian resonances These features are not accounted for by planetary perturbations in the current structure of the solar system but are consistent with dynamical ejection of asteroids by the sweeping of gravitational resonances during the migration of Jupiter and Saturn ~4 gigayears ago
(Abridged) We describe Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations of the populous 5 Myr-old open cluster NGC 2362 Early/intermediate-type confirmed/candidate cluster members either have photospheric mid-IR emission or weak optically-thin infrared excess emission at &lt; 24 microns consistent with debris disks Few late-type solar/subsolar-mass stars have primordial disks The disk population around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes (canonical &#39;transition disks&#39;) and &#39;homologously depleted&#39; disks
Both types of disks represent an intermediate stage between primordial disks and debris disks Thus we find that multiple paths for the primordial-to-debris disk transition exist Our results undermine standard arguments in favor of a ~ 0 01 Myr year timescale for the transition based on data from Taurus-Auriga and rule out standard UV photoevaporation scenarios as the primary mechanism to explain the transition
Combining our data with other Spitzer surveys we investigate the evolution of debris disks around high/intermediate-mass stars and investigate timescales for giant planet formation If the gas and dust in disks evolve on similar timescales the formation timescale for gas giant planets surrounding early-type high/intermediate-mass stars is likely 1--5 Myr
We apply scintillation theory to stellar signal fluctuations in the high-resolution high signal/noise dual-wavelength data from the MMT observation of the 2007 March 18 occultation of P445 3 by Pluto A well-defined high wavenumber cutoff in the fluctuations is consistent with viscous-thermal dissipation of buoyancy waves (internal gravity waves) in Pluto&#39;s high atmosphere
We present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolar planetary system WASP-5 obtained with the Danish 1 54m telescope at ESO La Silla In order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors we defocussed the telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter 40 pixels (16 arcsec)
Data reduction was undertaken using standard aperture photometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparison stars The resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0 50 mmag for the first transit and 0 59 mmag for the second We construct detailed signal to noise calculations for defocussed photometry
and apply them to our observations We model the light curves with the JKTEBOP code and combine the results with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive the physical properties of the WASP-5 system We find that the planet has a mass of M_b = 1 637 +/- 0
a radius of R_b = 1 171 +/- 0 056 +/- 0 012 Rjup a large surface gravity of g_b = 29 6 +/- 2 8 m/s2 and a density of rho_b = 1 02 +/- 0 14 +/- 0 01 rhojup (statistical and systematic uncertainties) The planet&#39;s high equilibrium temperature of T_eq = 1732 +/- 80 K makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses
Most of the known debris discs exhibit cool dust in regions analogous to the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt However a rare subset show hot excess from within a few AU which is often inferred to be transient We examine 2 such sources to place limits on their location to help distinguish between different interpretations for their origin
We use MIDI on the VLTI to observe the debris discs around eta Corvi and HD69830 using baseline lengths from 44-130m New VISIR observations of HD69830 at 18 7um are also presented These observations are compared with disc models to place limits on disc size The visibility functions measured with MIDI for both sources show significant variation with wavelength across 8-13um in a manner consistent with the disc flux being well resolved
notably with a dip at 10-11 5um due to the silicate emission feature The average ratio of visibilities measured between 10-11 5um and 8-9um is 0 934+/-0 015 for HD69830 and 0 880+/-0 013 for eta Corvi over the 4 baselines for each source a departure of 4 and 9sigma from that expected if the discs were unresolved
HD69830 is unresolved by VISIR at 18 7um The combined limits from MIDI and 8m imaging constrain the warm dust to lie within 0 05-2 4AU for HD69830 and 0 16-2 98AU for eta Corvi These results represent the first resolution in the mid-IR of dust around main sequence stars
The constraints placed on the location of the dust are consistent with radii predicted by SED modelling Tentative evidence for a common position angle for the dust at 1 7AU with that at 150AU around eta Corvi which might be expected if the hot dust is fed from the outer disc
We calculate heavy element enrichment in a Jupiter-mass protoplanet formed by disk instability at various radial distances from the star considering different disk masses and surface density distributions Although the available mass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface density (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha &lt; 2
the accretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances Efficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution when the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take place The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0 01 0
and 3/2 We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can accrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements depending on the disk properties Our results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in extra-solar giant planets Since higher disk surface density is found to lead to larger heavy element enrichment
our model results are consistent with the correlation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity Our calculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial distance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy elements predicted by interior models We conclude that in the disk instability model the final composition of a giant planet is strongly determined by its formation environment
Observations of circumstellar disks around stars as a function of stellar properties such as mass metallicity multiplicity and age provide constraints on theories concerning the formation and evolution of planetary systems Utilizing ground- and space-based data from the far-UV to the millimeter astronomners can assess the amount composition and location of circumstellar gas and dust as a function of time
We review primarily results from the Spitzer Space Telescope with reference to other ground- and space-based observations Comparing these results with those from exoplanet search techniques theoretical models as well as the inferred history of our solar system helps us to assess whether planetary systems like our own and the potential for life that they represent
The NASA/IPAC/NExScI Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED) is a general purpose stellar archive which supports NASA planet-finding and planet-characterization goals stellar astrophysics and the planning of NASA and other space missions There are two principal components of NStED a database of 140 000 nearby stars and exoplanet-hosting stars and an archive dedicated to high precision photometric surveys for transiting exoplanets (NStED-ETSS)
We present summaries of these components The NStED stellar database currently serves published parameters for 140 000 stars These parameters include coordinates multiplicity proper motion parallax spectral type multiband photometry radial velocity metallicity chromospheric and coronal activity index rotation velocity/period infrared excess NStED-ETSS currently serves data from the TrES survey of the Kepler field as well as dedicated photometric surveys of four stellar clusters
There have been numerous reports of anomalies during transits of the planet TrES-1b Recently Rabus and coworkers&#39; analysis of HST observations lead them to claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either a second transiting planet or a cool starspot Observations of two consecutive transits are presented here from the University of Arizona&#39;s 61-inch Kuiper Telescope on May 12 and May 15
A 5 4 +/- 1 7 mmag (0 54 +/- 0 17%) brightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12 and again in the second half of the transit on May 15th We conclude that this is a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspot rotating on the surface of the star
We suggest that all evidence to date suggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a second transiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies We are only able to constrain the rotational period of the star to 40 2 +22 9 -14 6 days
due to previous errors in measuring the alignment of the stellar spin axis with the planetary orbital axis This is consistent with the previously observed P_obs = 33 2 +22 3 -14 3 day period We note that this technique could be applied to other transiting systems for which starspots exist on the star in the transit path of the planet in order to constrain the rotation rate of the star
The Nice model of Gomes et al (2005) suggests that the migration of the giant planets caused a planetesimal clearing event which led to the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) at 880 Myr Here we investigate the IR emission from the Kuiper belt during the history of the Solar System as described by the Nice model
We describe a method for easily converting the results of n-body planetesimal simulations into observational properties (assuming black-body grains and a single size distribution) and further modify this method to improve its realism (using realistic grain properties and a three-phase size distribution) We compare our results with observed debris discs and evaluate the plausibility of detecting an LHB-like process in extrasolar systems
Recent surveys have shown that 4% of stars exhibit 24 um excess and 16% exhibit 70 um excess We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of these systems before the LHB at both 24 and 70 um We find a significant increase in 24 um emission during the LHB
which rapidly drops off and becomes undetectable within 30 Myr whereas the 70 um emission remains detectable until 360 Myr after the LHB Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution shows that such depletion events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of Sun-like stars and with this level of incidence we would expect approximately 1 of the 413 Sun-like
field stars so far detected to have a 24 um excess to be currently going through an LHB We also find that collisional processes are important in the Solar System before the LHB and that parameters for weak Kuiper belt objects are inconsistent with the Nice model interpretation of the LHB
Various aspects of the connection between cloud cover (CC) and cosmic rays (CR) are analysed We argue that the anticorrelation between the temporal behaviour of low (LCC) and middle (MCC) clouds evidences against causal connection between them and CR Nevertheless if a part of low clouds (LCC) is connected and varies with CR
We study the dynamical stability of an additional potentially habitable planet in the HD 47186 planetary system Two planets are currently known in this system a &#34;hot Neptune&#34; with a period of 4 08 days and a Saturn-mass planet with a period of 3 7 years Here we consider the possibility that one or more undetected planets exist between the two known planets and possibly within the habitable zone in this system
Given the relatively low masses of the known planets additional planets could have masses $\lsim 10 \mearth$ and hence be terrestrial-like and further improving potential habitability We perform $N$-body simulations to identify the stable zone between planets $b$ and $c$ and find that much of the inner habitable zone can harbor a $10 \mearth$ planet
With the current radial-velocity threshold of $\sim 1$ m/s an additional planet should be detectable if it lies at the inner edge of the habitable zone at 0 8 AU We also show that the stable zone could contain two additional planets of $10 \mearth$ each if their eccentricities are lower than $\sim 0
In this paper we extend our numerical method for simulating terrestrial planet formation from Leinhardt and Richardson (2005) to include dynamical friction from the unresolved debris component In the previous work we implemented a rubble pile planetesimal collision model into direct N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation The new collision model treated both accretion and erosion of planetesimals but did not include dynamical friction from debris particles smaller than the resolution limit for the simulation
By extending our numerical model to include dynamical friction from the unresolved debris we can simulate the dynamical effect of debris produced during collisions and can also investigate the effect of initial debris mass on terrestrial planet formation We find that significant initial debris mass 10% or more of the total disk mass
changes the mode of planetesimal growth Specifically planetesimals in this situation do not go through a runaway growth phase Instead they grow concurrently similar to oligarchic growth In addition to including the dynamical friction from the unresolved debris we have implemented particle tracking as a proxy for monitoring compositional mixing
We detected a brown dwarf-mass companion around the intermediate-mass giant star HD 119445 (G6III) using the Doppler technique This discovery is the first result from a Korean-Japanese planet search program based on precise radial velocity measurements The radial velocity of this star exhibits a periodic Keplerian variation with a period
semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 410 2 days 413 5 m/s and 0 082 respectively Adopting a stellar mass of 3 9 M_solar we were able to confirm the presence of a massive substellar companion with a semimajor axis of 1 71 AU and a minimum mass of 37 6 M_Jup
which falls in the middle of the brown dwarf-mass region This substellar companion is the most massive ever discovered within 3 AU of a central intermediate-mass star The host star also ranks among the most massive stars with substellar companions ever detected by the Doppler technique This result supports the current view of substellar systems that more massive substellar companions tend to exist around more massive stars
Various aspects of the connection between cloud cover (CC) and cosmic rays (CR) are analysed Many features of this connection indicate that there is no direct causal connection between low cloud cover (LCC) and CR in spite of the evident long-term correlation between them However most of these features are indirect
If only some part of the LCC is connected and varies with CR then its value obtained from the joint analysis of their 11-year variations and averaged over the globe should be most likely less than 20% <br>The most significant argument against a causal connection of CR and LCC is the anticorrelation between LCC and the medium cloud cover (MCC)
Eps Ind A is one of the nearest sun-like stars located only 3 6 pc away It is known to host a binary brown dwarf companion Eps Ind Ba/Bb at a large projected separation of 6 7&#34; but radial velocity measurements imply that an additional yet unseen component is present in the system
much closer to Eps Ind A Previous direct imaging has excluded the presence of any stellar or high-mass brown dwarf companion at small separations indicating that the unseen companion may be a low-mass brown dwarf or high-mass planet We present the results of a deep high-contrast imaging search for the companion
using active angular differential imaging (aADI) at 4 micron a particularly powerful technique for planet searches around nearby and relatively old stars We also develop an additional PSF reference subtraction scheme based on locally optimized combination of images (LOCI) to further enhance the detection limits No companion is seen in the images
although we are sensitive to significantly lower masses than previously achieved Combining the imaging data with the known radial velocity trend we constrain the properties of the companion to within approximately 5-20 Mjup 10-20 AU and i &gt; 20 deg unless it is an exotic stellar remnant The results also imply that the system is probably older than the frequently assumed age of ~1 Gyr
The discovery of over 400 extrasolar planets allows us to statistically test our understanding of formation and dynamics of planetary systems via numerical simulations Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without gas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the observed systems by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely packed when the gas disk dissipates
so that they become dynamically unstable within the stellar lifetime However such studies cannot explain the small semi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems if planets are formed as the standard planet formation theory suggests beyond the ice line <br>In this paper we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in dissipating gas disks
and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the observed semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously We adopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet formation theory and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution and planet migration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code We also take account of eccentricity damping
and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation resonances on the evolution of planetary systems We find that the semi-major axis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk while the eccentricity distribution is determined after the disk dissipation We also find that there may be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution
Our simulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations indicating that the disk&#39;s perturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed rate of MMRs We also find much lower occurrence of planets on retrograde orbits than the current observations of close-in planets suggest
This paper presents a generalized treatment of Type I planetary migration in the presence of stochastic perturbations In many planet-forming disks the Type I migration mechanism driven by asymmetric torques acts on a short time scale and compromises planet formation If the disk also supports MHD instabilities however the corresponding turbulent fluctuations produce additional stochastic torques that modify the steady inward migration scenario
This work studies the migration of planetary cores in the presence of stochastic fluctuations using complementary methods including a Fokker-Planck approach and iterative maps Stochastic torques have two main effects [1] Through outward diffusion a small fraction of the planetary cores can survive in the face of Type I inward migration
[2] For a given starting condition the result of any particular realization of migration is uncertain so that results must be described in terms of the distributions of outcomes In addition to exploring different regimes of parameter space this paper considers the effects of the outer disk boundary condition varying initial conditions
and time-dependence of the torque parameters For disks with finite radii the fraction of surviving planets decreases exponentially with time We find the survival fractions and decay rates for a range of disk models and find the expected distribution of locations for surviving planets For expected disk properties the survival fraction lies in the range $0
We have rereduced Spitzer IRS spectra and reanalyzed the SED&#39;s of three nearby debris disks lambda Boo HD 139664 and HR 8799 We find that that the thermal emission from these objects is well modeled using two single temperature black body components For HR 8799 -- with no silicate emission features despite a relatively hot inner dust component (Tgr = 150 K) -- we infer the presence of an asteroid belt interior to and a Kuiper Belt exterior to the recently discovered orbiting planets
For HD 139664 which has been imaged in scattered light we infer the presence of strongly forward scattering grains consistent with porous grains if the cold outer disk component generates both the observed scattered light and thermal emission Finally careful analysis of the lambda Boo SED suggests that this system possesses a central clearing
In this paper we present a new method for dating the surface of the Moon obtained by modeling the incoming flux of impactors and converting it into a size distribution of resulting craters We compare the results from this model with the standard chronology for the Moon showing their similarities and discrepancies
In particular we find indications of a non-constant impactor flux in the last 500 Myr and also discuss the implications of our findings for the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesis We also show the potential of our model for accurate dating of other inner Solar System bodies by applying it to Mercury
We study the tidal forcing propagation and dissipation of linear inertial waves in a rotating fluid body The intentionally simplified model involves a perfectly rigid core surrounded by a deep ocean consisting of a homogeneous incompressible fluid Centrifugal effects are neglected but the Coriolis force is considered in full and dissipation occurs through viscous or frictional forces
The dissipation rate exhibits a complicated dependence on the tidal frequency and generally increases with the size of the core In certain intervals of frequency efficient dissipation is found to occur even for very small values of the coefficient of viscosity or friction We discuss the results with reference to wave attractors
In this paper we will summarize some of the most important results of the Cassini mission concerning the satellites of Saturn Given the long duration of the mission the complexity of the payload onboard the Cassini Orbiter and the amount of data gathered on the satellites of Saturn it would be impossible to describe all the new discoveries made
therefore we will describe only some selected paramount examples showing how Cassini&#39;s data confirmed and extended ground-based observations In particular we will describe the achievements obtained for the satellites Phoebe Enceladus and Titan We will also put these examples in the perspective of the overall evolution of the system stressing out why the selected satellites are representative of the overall evolution of the Saturn system
Physics of the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) effect is discussed and compared with the statements published in the past thirty years Relativistically covariant formulation reveals the essence of the P-R effect and points out to nonphysical explanations in scientific papers and monographs Although the final equation of motion $m$ $d\vec{v} / dt$ $=$ ($S A&#39;\bar{Q&#39;}_{pr}$ $ / $ $c$) ${(1 - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{e} / c) \vec{e} - <br>\vec{v} / c}$ has been usually correctly presented and used
its derivation and explanation of its essence is frequently incorrect <br>The relativistically covariant form of the equation of motion yields the P-R effect as an action of the radiation pressure force on a moving spherical body No &#34;P-R drag&#34; as a particular relativistically covariant equation of motion exists Omission of the nonphysical term &#34;P-R drag&#34; excludes any confusion in the published definitions
<br>The difference between the effects of solar electromagnetic and corpuscular (solar wind) radiation is stressed The force acting on the particle due to the solar wind (the simple case of radial solar wind velocity is considered) is $\vec{F}_{sw}$ $=$ $F_{sw}$ [ (1 $-$ $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{e} / v_{sw}$) $\vec{e}$ $-$ $x&#39;$ $\vec{v} / v_{sw}$ ]
A movement is underway to test the uniqueness of Earth Sponsored primarily by NASA it is enlisting talented researchers from many disciplines It is conceiving new telescopes to discover and characterize other worlds like Earth around nearby stars and to obtain their spectra The goal is to search for signs of biological activity and perhaps find other cradles of life
<br>Most effort thus far has focused on the optics to make such observations feasible Relatively little attention has been paid to science operations--the link between instrument and science Because of the special challenges presented by extrasolar planets science-operational issues may be limiting factors for the &#34;Are We Alone?&#34; (AWA) movement
Science-operational metrics can help compare the merits of direct and astrometric planet searches and estimate the concatenated completeness of searching followed by spectroscopy This completeness is the prime science metric of the AWA program Therefore the goals of this white paper are to present representative calculations involving science-operational metrics and to promote a science-operational perspective
We employ the PLUTO code for computational astrophysics to assess and compare the validity of different numerical algorithms on simulations of the magneto-rotational instability in 3D accretion disks In particular we stress on the importance of using a consistent upwind reconstruction of the electro-motive force (EMF) when using the constrained transport (CT) method to avoid the onset of numerical instabilities
We show that the electro-motive force (EMF) reconstruction in the classical constrained transport (CT) method for Godunov schemes drives a numerical instability The well-studied linear growth of magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is used as a benchmark for an inter-code comparison of PLUTO and ZeusMP We reproduce the analytical results for linear MRI growth in 3D global MHD simulations and present a robust and accurate Godunov code which can be used for 3D accretion disk simulations in curvilinear coordinate systems
Observations of the CO J(1-0) 115 GHz and J(2-1) 230 GHz lines in comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) were performed with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer on 11 March 1997 The observations were conducted in both single-dish (ON-OFF) and interferometric modes with 0 13 km s-1 spectral resolution Images of CO emission with 1
The ON-OFF and interferometric spectra show a velocity shift with sinusoidal time variations related to the Hale-Bopp nucleus rotation of 11 35 h The peak position of the CO images moves perpendicularly to the spin axis direction in the plane of the sky This suggests the presence of a CO jet
which is active night and day at about the same extent and is spiralling with nucleus rotation The high quality of the data allows us to constrain the characteristics of this CO jet We have developed a 3-D model to interpret the temporal evolution of CO spectra and maps The CO coma is represented as the combination of an isotropic distribution and a spiralling gas jet
both of nucleus origin Spectra and visibilities (the direct output of interferometric data) analysis shows that the CO jet comprises ~40% the total CO production and is located at a latitude ~20 degrees North on the nucleus surface Our inability to reproduce all observational characteristics shows that the real structure of the CO coma is more complex than assumed
The detection of extrasolar planets&#39; atmospheres requires very demanding observations For planets that can not be spatially separated from their host stars i e the vast majority of planets the transiting planets are the only ones allowing to probe their atmospheres This is possible from transmission spectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse
An alternative is the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect which is sensitive to the size of the planetary radius Since the radius is wavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines this opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy The major goal of our numerical simulations is to provide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependent RM-effect
Our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectra modeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail Using these spectra we can obtain RM-curves for different wavelength regions and for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius Curves from regions with high and low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere can be compared
From these differential effects observable quantities are derived We applied our simulations to HD209458 Our numerical simulations show that a detailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is important for a precise analysis Compared to a parameterized limb darkening law systematic errors of 6 m/sec occur The wavelength dependency of the planetary atmospheres over the NaD-doublet produce a differential effect in the RM-curve of 1
Star formation is thought to be triggered by the gravitational collapse of the dense cores of molecular clouds Angular momentum conservation during the collapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force which eventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a central mass surrounded by a disc
In the presence of an angular momentum transport mechanism mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through this disc and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of their mass However the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular momentum are not well understood The most promising are turbulence viscosity driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI)
and outflows accelerated centrifugally from the surfaces of the disc Both processes are powered by the action of magnetic fields and are in turn likely to strongly affect the structure dynamics evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their host discs The weak ionization of protostellar discs however may prevent the magnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and drive these processes
Here I examine the viability and properties of these magnetically driven processes in protostellar discs The results indicate that despite the weak ionization the field is able to couple to the gas and shear for fluid conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of radii in these discs
This paper reviews the basic technical characteristics of the ground-based photometric searches for transiting planets and discusses a possible observational selection effect I suggest that additional photometric observations of the already observed fields might discover new transiting planets with periods around 4-6 days The set of known transiting planets support the intriguing correlation between the planetary mass and the orbital period suggested already in 2005
We recently reported the photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the 111-day-period eccentric extra-solar planet HD80606 b at Observatoire de Haute-Provence France (Moutou et al 2009) The whole egress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed allowing the measurement of the planetary radius
and evidence for a spin-orbit misalignment through the observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly The ingress having not been observed for this long-duration transit uncertainties remained in the parameters of the system We present here a refined combined analysis of our photometric and spectroscopic data together with further published radial velocities
ground-based photometry and Spitzer photometry around the secondary eclipse as well as new photometric measurements of HD 80606 acquired at Mount Hopkins Arizona just before the beginning of the primary transit Although the transit is not detected in those new data they provide an upper limit for the transit duration
which narrows down the possible behaviour of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part of the transit We analyse the whole data with a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo integration on all available information We find R_p = 0 98 +- 0 03 R_Jup for the planetary radius
and a total primary transit duration of 11 9 +- 1 3 hours from first to fourth contact Our analysis reinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignment excluded at &gt;95 % level) with a positive projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ~ 50 degrees)
Radiation recoil (YORP) torques are shown to be extremely sensitive to small-scale surface topography Starting from simulated objects representative of the near-Earth object population random realizations of three types of small-scale topography are added Gaussian surface fluctuations craters and boulders For each the resulting expected relative errors in the spin and obliquity components of the YORP torque are computed
Gaussian power produces errors of order 100% if observations constrain the surface to a spherical harmonic order l &lt; 10 A single crater with diameter roughly half the object&#39;s mean radius placed at random locations results in errors of several tens of percent Boulders create torque errors roughly 3 times larger than do craters of the same diameter
A single boulder comparable to Yoshinodai on 25143 Itokawa moved by as little as twice its own diameter can alter the magnitude of the torque by factors of several and change the sign of its spin component at all obliquities A YORP torque prediction derived from groundbased data can be expected to be in error by of order 100% due to unresolved topography
Small surface changes caused by slow spin-up or spin-down may have significant stochastic effects on the spin evolution of small bodies For rotation periods between roughly 2 and 10 hours these unpredictable changes may reverse the sign of the YORP torque Objects in this spin regime may random-walk up and down in spin rate before the rubble-pile limit is exceeded and fissioning or loss of surface objects occurs
The Trojan asteroids orbit about the Lagrangian points of Jupiter and the residence times about their present location are very long for most of them If these bodies originated in the outer Solar System they should be mainly composed of water ice but in contrast with comets all the volatiles close to the surface would have been lost long ago
Irrespective of the rotation period and hence the surface temperature and ice sublimation rate a dust layer exists always on the surface We show that the timescale for resurfacing the entire surface of the Trojan asteroids is similar to that of the flattening of the red spectrum of the new dust by solar-proton irradiation
Titan is one of the primary scientific objectives of the NASA ESA ASI Cassini Huygens mission Scattering by haze particles in Titan&#39;s atmosphere and numerous methane absorptions dramatically veil Titan&#39;s surface in the visible range though it can be studied more easily in some narrow infrared windows The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft successfully imaged its surface in the atmospheric windows
taking hyperspectral images in the range 0 4 5 2 ?m On 26 October (TA flyby) and 13 December 2004 (TB flyby) the Cassini Huygens mission flew over Titan at an altitude lower than 1200 km at closest approach We report here on the analysis of VIMS images of the Huygens landing site acquired at TA and TB
with a spatial resolution ranging from 16 to14 4 km/pixel The pure atmospheric backscattering component is corrected by using both an empirical method and a first-order theoretical model Both approaches provide consistent results After the removal of scattering ratio images reveal subtle surface heterogeneities A particularly contrasted structure appears in ratio images involving the 1
Although pure water ice cannot be the only component exposed at Titan&#39;s surface this area is consistent with a local enrichment in exposed water ice and seems to be consistent with DISR/Huygens images and spectra interpretations The images show also a morphological structure that can be interpreted as a 150 km diameter impact crater with a central peak
The subject of satellite formation is strictly linked to the one of planetary formation Giant planets strongly shape the evolution of the circum-planetary disks during their formation and thus indirectly influence the initial conditions for the processes governing satellite formation In order to fully understand the present features of the satellite systems of the giant planets
we need to take into account their formation environments and histories and the role of the different physical parameters In particular the pressure and temperature profiles in the circum-planetary nebulae shaped their chemical gradients by allowing the condensation of ices and noble gases These chemical gradients in turn set the composition of the satellitesimals
We report on observations of transit events of the transiting planets XO-1b and TrES-1 with a 25 cm telescope of the University Observatory Jena With the transit timings for XO-1b from all 50 available XO SuperWASP Transit Light Curve (TLC)-Project- and Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD)-data including our own I-band photometry obtained in March 2007
we find that the orbital period is P= (3 941501 +/- 0 000001) d a slight change by ~3 s compared to the previously published period We present new ephemeris for this transiting planet Furthermore we present new R-band photometry of two transits of TrES-1 With the help of all available transit times from literature this allows us to refine the estimate of the orbital period
New independent constraints on the amount of water delivered to Earth by comets are derived using the 15N/14N isotopic ratio measured to be roughly twice as high in cometary CN and HCN as in the present Earth Under reasonable assumptions we find that no more than a few percent of Earth&#39;s water can be attributed to comets
The aim is to show that in case of low probability of asteroid collision with Earth the appropriate selection and weighing of the data are crucial for the impact investigation and to analyze the impact possibilities using extensive numerical simulations By means of the Monte Carlo special method a large number of ``clone&#39;&#39; orbits have been generated
A full range of orbital elements in the 6-dimensional parameter space e g in the entire confidence region allowed by the observational material has been examined On the basis of 1000 astrometric observations of (99942) Apophis the best solution for the geocentric encounter distance of 6 065\pm 0 081 R_{Earth} were derived for the close encounter with the Earth on April 13
The present uncertainties allow for the special configurations (``keyholes&#39;&#39;) during these encounter which may lead to the very close encounters in the future approaches of Apophis Two groups of keyholes are connected with the close encounter with the Earth in 2036 (within the minimal distance of 5 7736-5 7763 R_{Earth} on April 13
We report on observations of several transit events of the transiting planet TrES-2 obtained with the Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera at the University Observatory Jena Between March 2007 and November 2008 ten different transits and almost a complete orbital period were observed Overall in 40 nights of observation 4291 exposures (in total 71
With the transit timings for TrES-2 from the 34 events published by the TrES-network the Transit Light Curve project and the Exoplanet Transit Database plus our own ten transits we find that the orbital period is P=(2 470614 +/- 0 000001) d a slight change by ~0 6 s compared to the previously published period
We present new ephemeris for this transiting planet Furthermore we found a second dip after the transit which could either be due to a blended variable star or occultation of a second star or even an additional object in the system Our observations will be useful for future investigations of timing variations caused by additional perturbing planets and/or stellar spots and/or moons
We define and analyze the photometric orbit (PhO) of an extrasolar planet observed in reflected light In our definition the PhO is a Keplerian entity with six parameters semimajor axis eccentricity mean anomaly at some particular time argument of periastron inclination angle and effective radius which is the square root of the geometric albedo times the planetary radius
Preliminarily we assume a Lambertian phase function We study in detail the case of short-period giant planets (SPGPs) and observational parameters relevant to the Kepler mission 20 ppm photometry with normal errors 6 5 hour cadence and three-year duration We define a relevant &#34;planetary population of interest&#34; in terms of probability distributions of the PhO parameters
We perform Monte Carlo experiments to estimate the ability to detect planets and to recover PhO parameters from light curves We calibrate the completeness of a periodogram search technique and find structure caused by degeneracy We recover full orbital solutions from synthetic Kepler data sets and estimate the median errors in recovered PhO parameters
We treat in depth a case of a Jupiter body-double For the stated assumptions we find that Kepler should obtain orbital solutions for many of the 100-760 SPGP that Jenkins &amp; Doyle (2003) estimate Kepler will discover Because most or all of these discoveries will be followed up by ground-based radial-velocity observations
In our ongoing search for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon star-forming region we recently (Schmidt et al 2008b) presented direct observations and integral field spectroscopy of a new common proper motion companion to the young T-Tauri star and Chamaeleon member CT Cha and discussed its properties in comparison to other young
low-mass objects and to synthetic model spectra from different origins We now obtained for the first time direct H-Band observations of the companion CT Cha b and of another faint companion candidate (cc2) approximately 1 9 arcsec northeast of CT Cha using the Adaptive Optics (AO) instrument Naos-Conica (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in February 2008
<br>From these data we can now exclude by 4 4 &amp; 4 8 sigma that CT Cha b is a non-moving background object and find cc2 to be most likely a background star of spectral type &lt;= K4 with a proper motion of mu{alpha} cos{delta} = -8 5 +/- 5
The discovery of CoRoT-7b a planet of radius 1 68 +/- 0 09 R_E mass 4 8 +/- 0 8 M_E and orbital period of 0 854 days demonstrates that small planets can orbit extremely close to their star We use knowledge of hot Jupiters mass loss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets to understand its composition
structure and evolution The inferred mass and radius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be depleted in iron relative to Earth However a one sigma increase in mass (5 6 M_E) and decrease in size (1 59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33% iron
Alternatively it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a significant amount of volatiles An equally good fit to the data is found for a vapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus Because of its intense irradiation and small size the planet cannot possess an envelope of H and He of more than 1/10
We show that the mass loss is significant (~ 10^11 g/s) and independent of planetary composition This is because the hydrodynamical escape rate is independent of the atmosphere&#39;s mean molecular mass and owing to the intense irradiation even a bare rocky planet would possess an equilibrium vapor atmosphere thick enough to capture stellar UV photons
This escape rate rules out the possibility of a H-He envelope as it would escape in only ~1 Ma A water vapor atmosphere would escape in ~ 1 Ga and thus it is a plausible scenario The origin of CoRoT-7b cannot be inferred from present observations It may have formed rocky; or be the remnant of a Uranus-like ice giant
We present a three dimensional hot Jupiter model extending from 200 bar to 1 mbar using the Intermediate General Circulation Model from the University of Reading Our horizontal spectral resolution is T31 (equivalent to a grid of 48x96) with 33 logarithmically spaced vertical levels A simplified (Newtonian) scheme is employed for the radiative forcing
We adopt a physical set up nearly identical to the model of HD 209458b by Cooper &amp; Showman (2005 2006) to facilitate a direct model inter-comparison Our results are broadly consistent with theirs but significant differences also emerge The atmospheric flow is characterized by a super-rotating equatorial jet transonic wind speeds
and eastward advection of heat away from the dayside We identify a dynamically-induced temperature inversion (&#34;stratosphere&#34;) on the planetary dayside and find that temperatures at the planetary limb differ systematically from local radiative equilibrium values a potential source of bias for transit spectroscopic interpretations While our model atmosphere is quasi-identical to that of Cooper &amp; Showman (2005
we use different algorithmic methods spectral-implicit vs grid-explicit which are known to yield fully consistent results in the Earth modeling context The model discrepancies identified here indicate that one or both numerical methods do not faithfully capture all of the atmospheric dynamics at work in the hot Jupiter context We highlight the emergence of a shock-like feature in our model
We discuss a model of cosmic ray acceleration that accounts for the observations of anomalous cosmic rays by Voyager 1 and 2 The model appeals to fast magnetic reconnection rather than shocks as the driver of acceleration The ultimate source of energy is associated with magnetic field reversals that occur in the heliosheath
It is expected that the magnetic field reversals will occur throughout the heliosheath but especially near the heliopause where the flows slows down and diverge in respect to the interstellar wind and also in the boundary sector-in the heliospheric current sheet While the First Order Fermi acceleration theory within reconnection layers is in its infancy
the available predictions do not contradict the available data on anomalous cosmic ray spectra measured by the spacecrafts We argue that the Voyager data can be one of the first pieces of evidence favoring the acceleration within regions of fast magnetic reconnection which we argue is a widely spread astrophysical process
Dusty disks around young stars are formed out of interstellar dust that consists of amorphous submicrometre grains Yet the grains found in comets and meteorites and traced in the spectra of young stars include large crystalline grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures in excess of 1
even though they are mixed with surrounding material that never experienced temperatures as high as that This prompted theories of large-scale mixing capable of transporting thermally altered grains from the inner hot part of accretion disks to outer colder disk region but all have assumptions that may be problematic Here I report that infrared radiation arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of the inner disk
whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure while gliding above the disk Grains re-enter the disk at radii where it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation pressure support for a given grain size and solid density Properties of the observed disks suggest that this process might be active in almost all young stellar objects and young brown dwarfs
We present detailed structure and evolution calculations for the first transiting extrasolar planets discovered by the space-based CoRoT mission Comparisons between theoretical and observed radii provide information on the internal composition of the CoRoT objects We distinguish three different categories of planets emerging from these discoveries and from previous ground-based surveys
(i) planets explained by standard planetary models including irradiation (ii) abnormally bloated planets and (iii) massive objects belonging to the overlapping mass regime between planets and brown dwarfs For the second category we show that tidal heating can explain the relevant CoRoT objects providing non-zero eccentricities We stress that the usual assumption of a quick circularization of the orbit by tides
as usually done in transit light curve analysis is not justified a priori as suggested recently by Levrard et al (2009) and that eccentricity analysis should be carefully redone for some observations Finally special attention is devoted to CoRoT-3b and to the identification of its very nature giant planet or brown dwarf ? The radius determination of this object confirms the theoretical mass-radius predictions for gaseous bodies in the substellar regime but
given the present observational uncertainties does not allow an unambiguous identification of its very nature This opens the avenue however to an observational identification of these two distinct astrophysical populations brown dwarfs and giant planets in their overlapping mass range as done for the case of the 8 Jupiter-mass object Hat-P-2b
We present evidence for condensed phase methane precipitation near Xanadu using nine nights of observations from the SINFONI integral-field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope and imaging analysis with empirical surface subtraction Radiative transfer models are used to support the imaging technique by simulating the spectrometer datacubes and testing for variations in both the surface reflectivity spectrum and atmospheric opacity
We use the models and observations together to argue against artifacts that may arise in the image analysis High phase angle observations from Cassini/VIMS are used to test against surface scattering artifacts that may be confused with sources of atmospheric opacity Although changes in the surface reflectivity spectrum can reproduce observations from a particular viewing geometry on a given night
Observations of four comets made with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer show the rotational envelope of the (0 0) band of the CO Hopfield-Birge system (C - X) at 1088 A to consist of both &#34;cold&#34; and &#34;hot&#34; components the &#34;cold&#34; component accounting for ~75% of the flux and with a rotational temperature in the range 55-75 K
We identify the &#34;hot&#34; component as coming from the dissociation of CO2 into rotationally &#34;hot&#34; CO with electron impact dissociation probably dominant over photodissociation near the nucleus An additional weak broad satellite band is seen centered near the position of the P(40) line that we attribute to CO fluorescence from a non-thermal high J rotational population produced by photodissociation of formaldehyde into CO and H2
This process also leaves the H2 preferentially populated in excited vibrational levels which are identified by fluorescent H2 lines in the spectrum excited by solar OVI 1031 9 and solar Lyman-alpha The amount of H2 produced by H2CO dissociation is comparable to the amount produced by photodissociation of H2O Electron impact excitation of CO
Recent lunar crater studies have revealed an asymmetric distribution of rayed craters on the lunar surface The asymmetry is related to the synchronous rotation of the Moon there is a higher density of rayed craters on the leading hemisphere compared with the trailing hemisphere Rayed craters represent generally the youngest impacts
The purpose of this paper is to test the hypotheses that (i) the population of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is the source of the impactors that have made the rayed craters and (ii) that impacts by this projectile population account quantitatively for the observed asymmetry We carried out numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of a large number of test particles representing NEAs in order to determine directly their impact flux on the Moon
The simulations were done in two stages In the first stage we obtained encounter statistics of NEAs on the Earth&#39;s activity sphere In the second stage we calculated the direct impact flux of the encountering particles on the surface of the Moon; the latter calculations were confined within the activity sphere of the Earth
A steady-state synthetic population of NEAs was generated from a debiased orbital distribution of the known NEAs We find that the near-Earth asteroids do have an asymmetry in their impact flux on the Moon apex-to-antapex ratio of 1 32 +/- 0 01 However the observed rayed crater distribution&#39;s asymmetry is significantly more pronounced
We observed (22) Kalliope and its companion Linus with the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS which is coupled to the adaptive optics system at the W M Keck II telescope on March 25 2008 We present for the first time component-resolved spectra acquired simultaneously in each of the Zbb (1-1 18 um)
Jbb (1 18-1 42 um) Hbb (1 47-1 80 um) and Kbb (1 97-2 38 um) bands The spectra of the two bodies are remarkably similar and imply that both bodies were formed at the same time from the same material; such as via incomplete re-accretion after a major impact on the precursor body
We explore the appearance of terrestrial planets in formation by studying the emergent spectra of hot molten protoplanets during their collisional formation While such collisions are rare the surfaces of these bodies may remain hot at temperatures of 1000-3000 K for up to millions of years during the epoch of their formation
These object are luminous enough in the thermal infrared to be observable with current and next generation optical/IR telescopes provided that the atmosphere of the forming planet permits astronomers to observe brightness temperatures approaching that of the molten surface Detectability of a collisional afterglow depends on properties of the planet&#39;s atmosphere -- primarily on the mass of the atmosphere
A planet with a thin atmosphere is more readily detected because there is little atmosphere to obscure the hot surface Paradoxically a more massive atmosphere prevents one from easily seeing the hot surface but also keeps the planet hot for a longer time In terms of planetary mass more massive planets are also easier to detect than smaller ones because of their larger emitting surface areas
We present preliminary calculations assuming a range of protoplanet masses (1-10 $M_\earth$) surface pressures (1-1000 bar) and atmospheric compositions for molten planets with surface temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 K in order to explore the diversity of emergent spectra that are detectable While current 8- to 10-m class ground-based telescopes may detect hot protoplanets at wide orbital separations beyond 30 AU (if they exist)
We have searched for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon star forming region Two epochs of direct imaging data were taken with the VLT Adaptive Optics instrument NaCo in February 2006 and March 2007 in Ks band for the classical T Tauri star CT Cha together with a Hipparcos binary for astrometric calibration
Moreover a J band image was taken in March 2007 to get color information We found CT Cha to have a very faint companion (Ks{0} = 14 6 mag) of ~ 2 67&#34; separation corresponding to ~ 440 AU We show that CT Cha A and the faint object form a common proper motion pair and that the companion is not a non-moving background object (with 4 sigma significance)
This paper presents an analysis that searched for systematic effects within the CoRoT exoplanet field light curves The analysis identified a systematic effect that modified the zero point of most CoRoT exposures as a function of stellar magnitude We could find this effect only after preparing a set of learning light curves that were relatively free of stellar and instrumental noise
How big were the first planetesimals? We attempt to answer this question by conducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutual collisions and form larger bodies and planetary embryos The size frequency distribution (SFD) of the initial planetesimals is considered a free parameter in these simulations and we search for the one that produces at the end objects with a SFD that is consistent with asteroid belt constraints
We find that if the initial planetesimals were small (e g km-sized) the final SFD fails to fulfill these constraints In particular reproducing the bump observed at diameter D~100km in the current SFD of the asteroids requires that the minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also ~100km This supports the idea that planetesimals formed big
namely that the size of solids in the proto-planetary disk ``jumped&#39;&#39; from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale without passing through intermediate values Moreover we find evidence that the initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100km probably even 1 000km and that their SFD had to have a slope over this interval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids in the same size-range
Over 300 extrasolar planets have been found since 1992 showing that planetary systems are common and exhibit an outstanding variety of characteristics As the number of detections grows and as models of planet formation progress to account for the existence of these new worlds statistical studies and confrontations of observation with theory allow to progressively unravel the key processes underlying planet formation
In this chapter we review the dominant contribution of Doppler spectroscopy to the present discoveries and to our general understanding of planetary systems We also emphasize the synergy of Doppler spectroscopy and transit photometry in characterizing the physical properties of transiting extrasolar planets As we will see Doppler spectroscopy has not reached its limits yet and it will undoubtly play a leading role in the detection and characterization of the first Earth-mass planets
It is known that near-Earth objects (NEOs) during their orbital evolution may often undergo close approaches to the Sun Indeed it is estimated that up to ~70% of them end their orbital evolution colliding with the Sun Starting from the present orbital properties it is possible to compute the most likely past evolution for every NEO
and to trace its distance from the Sun We find that a large fraction of the population may have experienced in the past frequent close approaches and thus as a consequence a considerable Sun-driven heating not trivially correlated to the present orbits The detailed dynamical behaviour the rotational and the thermal properties of NEOs determine the exact amount of the resulting heating due to the Sun
In the present paper we discuss the general features of the process providing estimates of the surface temperature reached by NEOs during their evolution Moreover we investigate the effects of this process on meteor-size bodies analyzing possible differences with the NEO population We also discuss some possible effects of the heating which can be observed through remote sensing by ground-based surveys or space missions
The Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) is a protoplanetary disk that contains the minimum amount of solids necessary to build the planets of the Solar System Assuming that the giant planets formed in the compact configuration they have at the beginning of the &#34;Nice model&#34; Desch (2007) built a new MMSN
He finds a decretion disk about ten times denser than the well-known Hayashi MMSN The disk profile is almost stationary for about ten million years However a planet in a protoplanetary disk migrates In a massive long-lived disk this question has to be addressed With numerical simulations we show that the four giant planets of the Solar System could not survive in this disk
In particular Jupiter enters the type III runaway regime and falls into the Sun like a stone Known planet-planet interaction mechanisms to prevent migration fail in this nebula in contrast to the Hayashi MMSN Planetary migration constrains the construction of a MMSN We show how this should be done self-consistently
The radioactive isotope $^{60}$Fe ($T_{1/2} = 1 5 $ Myr) was present in the early solar system It is unlikely that it was injected directly into the nascent solar system by a single nearby supernova It is proposed instead that it was inherited during the molecular cloud stage from several supernovae belonging to previous episodes of star formation
The expected abundance of $^{60}$Fe in star forming regions is estimated taking into account the stochasticity of the star-forming process and it is showed that many molecular clouds are expected to contain $^{60}$Fe (and possibly $^{26}$Al [$T_{1/2} = 0 74 $ Myr]) at a level compatible with that of the nascent solar system
Of the twenty amino acids used in proteins ten were formed in Miller&#39;s atmospheric discharge experiments The two other major proposed sources of prebiotic amino acid synthesis include formation in hydrothermal vents and delivery to Earth via meteorites We combine observational and experimental data of amino acid frequencies formed by these diverse mechanisms and show that
regardless of the source these ten early amino acids can be ranked in order of decreasing abundance in prebiotic contexts This order can be predicted by thermodynamics The relative abundances of the early amino acids were most likely reflected in the composition of the first proteins at the time the genetic code originated
We present the results of a deep wide-field transit survey targeting Hot Jupiter planets in the Lupus region of the Galactic plane conducted over 53 nights concentrated in two epochs separated by a year Using the Australian National University 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) the survey covered a 0
deg region close to the Galactic Plane (b=11 deg ) and monitored a total of 110 372 stars (15 0&lt;V&lt;22 0) Using difference imaging photometry 16 134 light curves with a photometric precision of sigma&lt;0 025 mag were obtained These light curves were searched for transits and four candidates were detected that displayed low-amplitude variability consistent with a transiting giant planet
Further investigations including spectral typing and radial velocity measurements for some candidates revealed that of the four one is a true planetary companion (Lupus-TR-3) two are blended systems (Lupus-TR-1 and 4) and one is a binary (Lupus-TR-2) The results of this successful survey are instructive for optimizing the observational strategy and follow-up procedure for deep searches for transiting planets
Some principles in the distribution of Centaurs and the &#34;Scattered Disk&#34; objects as well as the Kuiper belt objects for its semi-major axes eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits have been investigated It has been established that more than a half from them move on the resonant orbits and that is what has been predicted earlier
If a dynamical system is long-lived and non-resonant (that is if there is a set of tracers that have evolved independently through many orbital times) and if the system is observed at any non-special time it is possible to infer the dynamical properties of the system (such as the gravitational force or acceleration law) from a snapshot of the positions and velocities of the tracer population at a single moment in time
In this paper we describe a general inference technique that solves this problem while allowing (1) the unknown distribution function of the tracer population to be simultaneously inferred and marginalized over and (2) prior information about the gravitational field and distribution function to be taken into account As an example
we consider the simplest problem of this kind We infer the force law in the Solar System using only an instantaneous kinematic snapshot (valid at 2009 April 1 0) for the eight major planets We consider purely radial acceleration laws of the form a_r = -A [r/r_0]^{-\alpha} where r is the distance from the Sun
Using a probabilistic inference technique we infer 1 989 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2 052 (95 percent interval) largely independent of any assumptions about the distribution of energies and eccentricities in the system beyond the assumption that the system is phase-mixed Generalizations of the methods used here will permit among other things
The TrES-2 system harbors one planet which was discovered with the transit technique In this work we investigate the dynamical behavior of possible additional lower-mass planets We identify the regions where such planets can move on stable orbits and show how they depend on the initial eccentricity and inclination We find
Currently the only technique sensitive to Earth mass planets around nearby stars (that are too close for microlensing) is the monitoring of the transit time variations of the transiting extrasolar planets We search for additional planets in the systems of the hot Neptune GJ 436b and the hot-Jupiter XO-1b using high cadence observations in the J and Ks bands
New high-precision transit timing measurements are reported GJ 436b Tc = 2454238 47898 \pm 0 00046 HJD; XO-1b Tc(A) = 2454218 83331 \pm 0 00114 HJD Tc(B) = 2454222 77539 \pm 0 00036 HJD Tc(C) = 2454222 77597 \pm 0 00039 HJD Tc(D) = 2454226 71769 \pm 0 00034 HJD
and they were used to derive new ephemeris We also determined depths for these transits No statistically significant timing deviations were detected We demonstrate that the high cadence ground based near-infrared observations are successful in constraining the mean transit time to ~30 sec and are a viable alternative to space missions
The structure of the Taurid meteor complex based on photographic orbits available in the IAU Meteor database is studied We have searched for potential sub-streams or filaments to be associated with the complex utilizing the Southworth-Hawkins D-criterion Applying a strict limiting value for D=0 10 fifteen sub-streams or filaments consisting of more than three members
could be separated out from the general complex To confirm their mutual consistence as filaments rather than fortuitous clumping at the present time the orbital evolution over 5000 years of each member is studied Utilizing the D-criterion we also searched for NEOs that might be associated with the streams and filaments of the complex and investigated the orbital evolution of potential members
Possible associations between 7 Taurid filaments and 9 NEOs were found The most probable are for S Psc(b) -- 2003QC10 N Tau(a) -- 2004TG10 o Ori -- 2003UL3 and N Tau(b) -- 2002XM35 Some of the potential parent objects could be either dormant comets or larger boulders moving within the complex
We investigate the unsaturated horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet by an isothermal gaseous disk In the globally isothermal case we use a formal- ism based on the use of a Bernoulli invariant that takes into account pressure effects and that extends the torque estimate to a region wider than the horse- shoe region
We find a result that is strictly identical to the standard horseshoe drag This shows that the horseshoe drag accounts for the torque of the whole corotation region and not only of the horseshoe region thereby deserving to be called corotation torque We find that evanescent waves launched downstream of the horseshoe U-turns by the perturbations of vortensity exert a feed-back on the upstream region
that render the horseshoe region asymmetric This asymmetry scales with the vortensity gradient and with the disk&#39;s aspect ratio It does not depend on the planetary mass and it does not have any impact on the horseshoe drag Since the horseshoe drag has a steep dependence on the width of the horseshoe region
we provide an adequate definition of the width that needs to be used in horseshoe drag estimates We then consider the case of locally isothermal disks in which the tempera- ture is constant in time but depends on the distance to the star The horseshoe drag appears to be different from the case of a globally isothermal disk
The difference which is due to the driving of vortensity in the vicinity of the planet is intimately linked to the topology of the flow We provide a descriptive inter- pretation of these effects as well as a crude estimate of the dependency of the excess on the temperature gradient
We evaluate the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet embedded in a gaseous disk assuming the disk&#39;s flow in the coorbital region to be adiabatic We restrict this analysis to the case of a planet on a circular orbit and we assume a steady flow in the corotating frame
We also assume that the corotational flow upstream of the U-turns is unperturbed so that we discard saturation effects In addition to the classical expression for the horseshoe drag in barotropic disks which features the vortensity gradient across corotation we find an additional term which scales with the entropy gradient
and whose amplitude depends on the perturbed pressure at the stagnation point of the horseshoe separatrices This additional torque is exerted by evanescent waves launched at the horseshoe separatrices as a consequence of an asymmetry of the horseshoe region It has a steep dependence on the potential&#39;s softening length suggesting that the effect can be extremely strong in the three dimensional case
We describe the main properties of the coorbital region (the production of vortensity during the U-turns the appearance of vorticity sheets at the downstream separatrices and the pressure response) and we give torque expressions suitable to this regime of migration Side results include a weak negative feed back on migration
We show that hemispherical dynamos can result from weak equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow in the interior of planets and stars Using a model of spherical dynamo we observe that the interaction between a dipolar and a quadrupolar mode can localize the magnetic field in only one hemisphere when the equatorial symmetry is broken
Hot Jupiters are a class of extrasolar planet that orbit their parent stars at very short distances Due to their close proximity they are expected to be tidally locked which can lead to a large temperature difference between their day and nightsides Infrared observations of eclipsing systems have yielded dayside temperatures for a number of transiting planets
Furthermore the day-night contrast of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 189733b was mapped using infrared observations It is expected that the contrast between the dayside and nightside of hot Jupiters is much higher at visual wavelengths as we move shortward of the peak emission and could be further enhanced by reflected stellar light
Here we report on the analysis of optical photometric data of the transiting hot Jupiter CoRoT-1b which cover 36 planetary orbits The nightside hemisphere of the planet is consistent with being entirely black with the dayside flux dominating the optical phase curve This means that at optical wavelengths the planet&#39;s phase variation is just as we see it for the interior planets in our own solar system
The identification of an extrasolar planet as Earth-like will depend on the detection of atmospheric signatures or surface non-uniformities In this paper we present spatially unresolved flux light curves of Earth for the purpose of studying a prototype extrasolar terrestrial planet Our monitoring of the photometric variability of earthshine revealed changes of up to 23 % per hour in the brightness of Earth&#39;s scattered light at around 600 nm
due to the removal of specular reflection from the view of the Moon This variability is accompanied by reddening of the spectrum and results from a change in surface properties across the continental boundary between the Indian Ocean and Africa&#39;s east coast Our results based on earthshine monitoring indicate that specular reflection should provide a useful tool in determining the presence of liquid water on extrasolar planets via photometric observations
Neutrino radiography may provide an alternative tool to study the very deep structures of the Earth Though these measurements are unable to resolve the fine density layer features nevertheless the information which can be obtained are independent and complementary to the more conventional seismic studies The aim of this paper is to assess how well the core and mantle averaged densities can be reconstructed through atmospheric neutrino radiography
The distribution of the orbits of close-in exoplanets shows evidence for on-going removal and destruction by tides Tides raised on a planet&#39;s host star cause the planet&#39;s orbit to decay even after the orbital eccentricity has dropped to zero Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and predictions of tidal theory show good qualitative agreement
suggesting tidal destruction of close-in exoplanets is common The process can explain the observed cut-off in small a-values the clustering of orbital periods near three days and the relative youth of transiting planets Contrary to previous considerations a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required
Planets nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small a possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope The recently discovered CoRoT-Exo-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs Also where one or more planets have already been accreted
We present preliminary results on the ability of self-gravitating discs to cool in response to their internal heating These discs are modelled using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code with radiative transfer (Whitehouse Bate &amp; Monaghan 2005) and we investigate the ability of these discs to maintain a state of thermal equilibrium with their boundaries as an indication of their likelihood to fragment
We present Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared transit photometry of the nearby hot-Jupiter HD189733b The observations were taken with the NICMOS instrument during five transits with three transits executed with a narrowband filter at 1 87 microns and two performed with a narrowband filter at 1 66 microns Our observing strategy using narrowband filters is insensitive to the usual HST intra-orbit and orbit-to-orbit measurement of systematic errors
allowing us to accurately and robustly measure the near-IR wavelength dependance of the planetary radius Our measurements fail to reproduce the Swain et al absorption signature of atmospheric water below 2 microns at a 5-sigma confidence level We measure a planet-to-star radius contrast of 0 15498+/-0 00035 at 1 66 microns and a contrast of 0
We report the detection of a substellar companion orbiting the G5 dwarf HD 16760 from the N2K sample Precise Doppler measurements of the star from Subaru and Keck revealed a Keplerian velocity variation with a period of 466 47+-0 35 d a semiamplitude of 407 71+-0 84 m/s and an eccentricity of 0
Adopting a stellar mass of 0 78+-0 05 M_Sun we obtain a minimum mass for the companion of 13 13+-0 56 M_JUP which is close to the planet/brown-dwarf transition and the semimajor axis of 1 084+-0 023 AU The nearly circular orbit despite the large mass and intermediate orbital period makes this companion unique among known substellar companions
Efficient computation of the quadrupole light deflection for quasars/quasars and solar system objects within the framework of the baseline Gaia relativity model (GREM) is discussed Two refinements have been achieved with the goal to improve the performance of the model First the quadrupole deflection formulas for both cases are simplified as much as possible considering the Gaia nominal orbit (only approximate minimal distances between Gaia and the giant planets were used here)
physical parameters of the giant planets and the envisaged accuracy of 1 microarcsecond for individual systematic effects The recommended formulas are given by Eq (40) for stars/quasars and by Eq (81) for solar system objects Second simple expressions for the upper estimate of the quadrupole light deflection have been found allowing
with a few additional arithmetical operations to judge a priori if the quadrupole light deflection should be computed or not for a given source and for a given requested accuracy The recommended criteria are given by Eq (45) for stars/quasars and by Eq (92) for solar system objects Additionally the quadrupole Shapiro effect for solar system objects is reconsidered
The Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM Harris 1998) has proven to be a reliable simple thermal model for radiometric diameter determination However NEATM assumes zero thermal emission on the night side of an asteroid We investigate how this assumption affects the best-fit beaming parameter overestimates the effective diameter and underestimates the albedo at large phase angles
by testing NEATM on thermal IR fluxes generated from simulated asteroid surfaces with different thermal inertia We compare NEATM to radar diameters and find that NEATM overestimates the diameter when the beaming parameter is fitted to multi-wavelength observations and underestimates the diameter when the default beaming parameter is used The Night Emission Simulated Thermal Model (NESTM) is introduced
NESTM models the night side temperature as an iso-latitudinal fraction (f) of the maximum day side temperature (Maximum temperature calculated for NEATM with beaming parameter = 1) A range of f is found for different thermal parameters which depend on the thermal inertia NESTM diameters are compared with NEATM and radar diameters
We present numerical simulations of electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) and electron reduced MHD (ERMHD) turbulence Comparing scaling relations we find that both EMHD and ERMHD turbulence show similar spectra and anisotropy We develop new techniques to study anisotropy of EMHD turbulence Our detailed study of anisotropy of EMHD turbulence supports our earlier result of k_par ~ k_perp^(1/3) scaling
We find that the high-order statistics show a scaling that is similar to the She-Leveque scaling We observe that the bispectra which characterize the interaction of different scales within the turbulence cascade are very different for EMHD and MHD turbulence We show that both decaying and driven EMHD turbulence have the same statistical properties
We calculate the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of MHD and EMHD turbulence and compare them with those of interplanetary turbulence We find that as in the case of the solar wind the PDFs of the increments of magnetic field strength in MHD and EMHD turbulence are well described by the Tsallis distribution
We study the distribution and physical properties of molecular gas in the disc around the T Tauri star IM Lup on scales close to 200 AU We investigate how well the gas and dust distributions compare and work towards a unified disc model that can explain both gas and dust emission
and C18O J=2-1 line emission as well as the dust continuum at 1 3 mm is observed at 1 8&#34; resolution towards IM Lup using the Submillimeter Array A detailed disc model based on the dust emission is tested against these observations with the aid of a molecular excitation and radiative transfer code
Apparent discrepancies between the gas and dust distribution are investigated by adopting simple modifications to the existing model The disc is seen at an inclination of 54+/-3 degrees and is in Keplerian rotation around a 0 8-1 6 Msun star The outer disc radius traced by molecular gas emission is 900 AU
while the dust continuum emission and scattered light images limit the amount of dust present beyond 400 AU and are consistent with the existing model that assumes a 400 AU radius Our observations require a drastic density decrease close to 400 AU with the vertical gas column density at 900 AU in the range of 5
(Abridged) The following describes a model of a broad planetary ring whose sharp edge is confined by a satellite&#39;s m^th Lindblad resonance (LR) This model uses a streamline formalism to calculate the ring&#39;s internal forces namely ring gravity pressure viscosity as well as a hypothetical drag force The model calculates the streamlines&#39; forced orbit elements and surface density throughout the perturbed ring
The model is then applied to the outer edge of Saturn&#39;s B ring which is maintained by an m=2 inner LR with the satellite Mimas Ring models are used to illustrate how a ring&#39;s perturbed state depends on the ring&#39;s physical properties surface density viscosity dispersion velocity and the hypothetical drag force
A comparison of models to the observed outer B ring suggests that the ring&#39;s surface density there is between 10 and 280 gm/cm^2 The ring&#39;s edge also indicates where the viscous torque counterbalances the perturbing satellite&#39;s gravitational torque on the ring But an examination of seemingly conventional viscous B ring models shows that they all fail to balance these torques at the ring&#39;s edge
This is due ring self-gravity and the fact that a viscous ring tends to be nearly peri-aligned with the satellite which reduces the satellite&#39;s torque on the ring and makes the ring&#39;s edge more difficult to maintain Nonetheless the following shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B ring
We apply the MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits) technique to the dynamics of Jovian irregular satellites We demonstrate the efficiency of applying the MEGNO indicator to generate a mapping of relevant phase-space regions occupied by observed jovian irregular satellites The construction of MEGNO maps of the Jovian phase-space region within its Hill-sphere is addressed and the obtained results are compared with previous studies regarding the dynamical stability of irregular satellites
Since this is the first time the MEGNO technique is applied to study the dynamics of irregular satellites we provide a review of the MEGNO theory We consider the elliptic restricted three-body problem in which Jupiter is orbited by a massless test satellite subject to solar gravitational perturbations The equations of motion of the system are integrated numerically and the MEGNO indicator computed from the systems variational equations
An unprecedented large set of initial conditions are studied to generate the MEGNO maps The chaotic nature of initial conditions are demonstrated by studying a quasi-periodic orbit and a chaotic orbit As a result we establish the existence of several high-order mean-motion resonances detected for retrograde orbits along with other interesting dynamical features
Astrometry can detect rocky planets in a broad range of masses and orbital distances and measure their masses and three-dimensional orbital parameters including eccentricity and inclination to provide the properties of terrestrial planets The masses of both the new planets and the known gas giants can be measured unambiguously allowing a direct calculation of the gravitational interactions
both past and future Such dynamical interactions inform theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems including Earth-like planets Astrometry is the only technique technologically ready to detect planets of Earth mass in the habitable zone (HZ) around solar-type stars within 20 pc These Earth analogs are close enough for follow-up observations to characterize the planets by infrared imaging and spectroscopy with planned future missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder/Darwin
Employing a demonstrated astrometric precision of 1 microarcsecond and a noise floor under 0 1 micro-arcseconds SIM Lite can make multiple astrometric measurements of the nearest 60 F- G- and K-type stars during a five-year mission SIM Lite directly tests theories of rocky planet formation and evolution around Sun-like stars and identifies the nearest potentially habitable planets for later spaceborne imaging
Stars and planets are the fundamental objects of the Universe Their formation processes though related may differ in important ways Stars almost certainly form from gravitational collapse and probably have formed this way since the first stars lit the skies Although it is possible that planets form in this way also
processes involving accretion in a circumstellar disk have been favored High fidelity high resolution images may resolve the question; both processes may occur in some mass ranges The questions to be answered in the next decade include <br>By what process do planets form and how does the mode of formation determine the character of planetary systems? <br>What is the distribution of masses of planets? In what manner does the metallicity of the parent star influence the character of its planetary system? <br>In this paper we discuss the observations of planetary systems from birth to maturity
This paper introduces a new disk code called ProDiMo to calculate the thermo-chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and to interpret gas emission lines from UV to sub-mm We combine frequency-dependent 2D dust continuum radiative transfer kinetic gas-phase and UV photo-chemistry ice formation and detailed non-LTE heating &amp; cooling balance with the consistent calculation of the hydrostatic disk structure
We include FeII and CO ro-vibrational line heating/cooling relevant for the high-density gas close to the star and apply a modified escape probability treatment The models are characterized by a high degree of consistency between the various physical chemical and radiative processes where the mutual feedbacks are solved iteratively In application to a T Tauri disk extending from 0
the models are featured by a puffed-up inner rim and show that the dense shielded and cold midplane (z/r&lt;0 1 Tg~Td) is surrounded by a layer of hot (5000K) and thin (10^7 to 10^8 cm^-3) atomic gas which extends radially to about 10AU and vertically up to z/r~0 5 This layer is predominantly heated by the stellar UV (e
g PAH-heating) and cools via FeII semi-forbidden and OI 630nm optical line emission The dust grains in this &#34;halo&#34; scatter the star light back onto the disk which impacts the photo-chemistry The more distant regions are characterized by a cooler flaring structure Beyond 100AU Tgas decouples from Tdust even in the midplane and reaches values of about Tg~2Td
This paper addresses the fine-scale axisymmetric structure exhibited in Saturn&#39;s A and B-rings We aim to explain both the periodic microstructure on 150-220m revealed by the Cassini UVIS and RSS instruments and the irregular variations in brightness on 1-10km reported by the Cassini ISS We propose that the former structures correspond to the peaks and troughs of the nonlinear wavetrains that form naturally in a viscously overstable disk
The latter variations on longer scales may correspond to modulations and defects in the wavetrains&#39; amplitudes and wavelength We explore these ideas using a simple hydrodynamical model which captures the correct qualitative behaviour of a disk of inelastically colliding particles while also permitting us to make progress with analytic and semi-analytic techniques
Motivated by debris disk studies we investigate the gravitational microlensing of background starlight by a planetesimal disk around a foreground star We use dynamical survival models to construct a plausible example of a planetesimal disk and study its microlensing properties using established ideas of microlensing by small bodies When a solar-type source star passes behind a planetesimal disk
the microlensing light curve may exhibit short-term low-amplitude residuals caused by planetesimals several orders of magnitude below Earth mass The minimum planetesimal mass probed depends on the photometric sensitivity and the size of the source star and is lower when the planetesimal lens is located closer to us Planetesimal lenses may be found more nearby than stellar lenses because the steepness of the planetesimal mass distribution changes how the microlensing signal depends on the lens/source distance ratio
(Abridged) An anisotropic theory of MHD turbulence with nonvanishing cross-helicity is constructed based on Boldyrev&#39;s alignment hypothesis and probabilities p and q for fluctuations v and b to be positively or negatively aligned Guided by observations suggesting that the normalized cross-helicity and the probability p are approximately constant in the inertial range
The role of magnetic fields for the formation of planets is reviewed Protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability has a huge influence on the early stages of planet formation Small dust grains are transported both vertically and radially in the disc by turbulent diffusion counteracting sedimentation to the mid-plane and transporting crystalline material from the hot inner disc to the outer parts
The conclusion from recent efforts to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of magnetorotational turbulence is that turbulent diffusion of small particles is much stronger than naively thought Larger particles -- pebbles rocks and boulders -- get trapped in long-lived high pressure regions that arise spontaneously at large scales in the turbulent flow
These gas high pressures in geostrophic balance with a sub-Keplerian/super-Keplerian zonal flow envelope are excited by radial fluctuations in the Maxwell stress The coherence time of the Maxwell stress is only a few orbits where as the correlation time of the pressure bumps is comparable to the turbulent mixing time-scale
many tens or orbits on scales much greater than one scale height The particle overdensities contract under the combined gravity of all the particles and condense into gravitationally bound clusters of rocks and boulders These planetesimals have masses comparable to the dwarf planet Ceres I conclude with thoughts on future priorities in the field of planet formation in turbulent discs
This paper is an extension of the work done by Pierens &amp; Nelson (2008) in which they have investigated the behaviour of a two-planet system embedded in a protoplanetary disc They have put a Jupiter mass gas giant on the internal orbit and a lower mass planet on the external one
We consider here a similar problem taking into account a gas giant with masses in the range of 0 5 to 1 Jupiter mass and a Super-Earth as the outermost planet By changing disc parameters and planet masses we have succeeded in getting the convergent migration which allows for the possibility of their resonant locking
However in the case in which the gas giant has the mass of Jupiter before any mean motion first order commensurability could be achieved the Super-Earth is caught in a trap when it is very close to the edge of the gap opened by the giant planet This confirms the result obtained by Pierens &amp; Nelson (2008) in their simulations
Additionally we have found that in a very thin disc an apsidal resonance is observed in the system if the Super-Earth is captured in the trap Moreover the eccentricity of the small planet remains low while that of the gas giant increases slightly due to the imbalance between Lindblad and corotational resonances
We have also studied analogous systems in which the gas giant is allowed to take Sub-Jupiter masses In this case after performing an extensive survey over all possible parameters we have succeeded in getting the 1 2 mean motion resonant configuration only in a disc with low aspect ratio and low surface density
We present the measurements of sky surface brightness on Mount Graham International Observatory obtained during the first binocular-mode science runs at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) A total of 860 images obtained on 23 moonless nights in the period Feb 2008-Jun 2008 were analyzed with our data quality assessment procedure

We report the discovery of WASP-13b a low-mass $ M_p = 0 46 ^{+ 0 06}_{- 0 05} M_J$ transiting exoplanet with an orbital period of $4 35298 \pm 0 00004$ days The transit has a depth of 9 mmag and although our follow-up photometry does not allow us to constrain the impact parameter well ($0 &lt; b &lt; 0
with radius in the range $R_p \sim 1 06 - 1 21 R_J$ the location of WASP-13b in the mass-radius plane is nevertheless consistent with H/He-dominated irradiated low core mass and core-free theoretical models The G1V host star is similar to the Sun in mass (M$_{*} = 1 03^{+0 11}_ {- 0
We investigate the chance of detecting proto-planetary or debris disks in stars that induce microlensing events (lenses) The modification of the light curves shapes due to occultation and extinction by the disks as well as the additional gravitational deflection caused by the additional mass is considered The magnification of gravitational microlensing events is calculated using the ray shooting method
The occultation is taken into account by neglecting or weighting the images on the lens plane according to a transmission map of the corresponding disk for a point source point lens (PSPL) model The estimated frequency of events is obtained by taking the possible inclinations and optical depths of the disk into account
We conclude that gravitational microlensing can be used in principle as a tool for detecting debris disks beyond 1 kpc but estimate that each year of the order of 1 debris disk is expected for lens stars of F G or K spectral type and of the order of 10 debris disks might have shown signatures in existing datasets
In this paper we discuss how we can read a planets spectrum to assess its habitability and search for the signatures of a biosphere After a decade rich in giant exoplanet detections observation techniques have now reached the ability to find planets of less than 10 MEarth (so called Super-Earths) that may potentially be habitable
How can we characterize those planets and assess if they are habitable? The new field of extrasolar planet search has shown an extraordinary ability to combine research by astrophysics chemistry biology and geophysics into a new and exciting interdisciplinary approach to understand our place in the universe The results of a first generation mission will most likely result in an amazing scope of diverse planets that will set planet formation
Earthshine is sunlight that has been reflected from the dayside Earth onto the dark side of the Moon and back again to Earth In recent times there has been renewed interest in ground-based visible and near-infrared measurements of earthshine as a proxy for exoplanet observations Observations of earthshine allow us to explore and characterize the globally integrated photometric
spectral and polarimetric features of the Earth and to extract precise information on the distinctive characteristics of our planet and life in particular They also allow us to quantify how this feature changes with time and orbital configuration Here we present a brief review of the main earthshine observations and results
The stability of Trojan type orbits around Neptune is studied As the first part of our investigation we present in this paper a global view of the stability of Trojans on inclined orbits Using the frequency analysis method based on the FFT technique we construct high resolution dynamical maps on the plane of initial semimajor axis $a_0$ versus inclination $i_0$
These maps show three most stable regions with $i_0$ in the range of $(0^\circ 12^\circ) (22^\circ 36^\circ)$ and $(51^\circ 59^\circ)$ respectively where the Trojans are most probably expected to be found The similarity between the maps for the leading and trailing triangular Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ confirms the dynamical symmetry between these two points
By computing the power spectrum and the proper frequencies of the Trojan motion we figure out the mechanisms that trigger chaos in the motion The Kozai resonance found at high inclination varies the eccentricity and inclination of orbits while the $\nu_8$ secular resonance around $i_0\sim44^\circ$ pumps up the eccentricity Both mechanisms lead to eccentric orbits and encounters with Uranus that introduce strong perturbation and drive the objects away from the Trojan like orbits
This explains the clearance of Trojan at high inclination ($&gt;60^\circ$) and an unstable gap around $44^\circ$ on the dynamical map An empirical theory is derived from the numerical results with which the main secular resonances are located on the initial plane of $(a_0 i_0)$ The fine structures in the dynamical maps can be explained by these secular resonances
Our aim is to determine the isotopic ratios {$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C}{} and {$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N}{} in a variety of comets and link these measurements to the formation and evolution of the solar system The {$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C}{} and {$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N}{} isotopic ratios are measured {for} the CN radical by means of high-resolution optical spectra of the R branch of the B-X (0
{23 comets from different dynamical classes} have been observed sometimes at various heliocentric {and nucleocentric} distances in order to estimate possible variations of the isotopic ratios in parent molecules The {$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C}{} and {$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N}{} isotopic ratios in CN are remarkably constant (average values of respectively $91 0\pm3 6$ and $147 8\pm5
for all comets whatever their origin or heliocentric distance While the carbon isotopic ratio does agree with the terrestrial value (89) the nitrogen ratio is a factor of two lower than the terrestrial value (272) indicating a fractionation in the early solar system or in the protosolar nebula common to all the comets of our sample
The final stage of planet formation is dominated by collisions between planetary embryos The dynamics of this stage determine the orbital configuration and the mass and composition of planets in the system In the solar system late giant impacts have been proposed for Mercury Earth Mars and Pluto In the case of Mercury
this giant impact may have significantly altered the bulk composition of the planet Here we present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of high-velocity (up to ~5 v_esc) collisions between 1 and 10 M_Earth planets of initially terrestrial composition to investigate the end stages of formation of extrasolar super-Earths
As found in previous simulations of collisions between smaller bodies when collision energies exceed simple merging giant impacts are divided into two regimes (1) disruption and (2) hit-and-run (a grazing inelastic collision and projectile escape) Disruption occurs when the impact parameter is near zero when the projectile mass is small compared to the target
or at extremely high velocities In the disruption regime we derive the criteria for catastrophic disruption (when half the total colliding mass is lost) the transition energy between accretion and erosion and a scaling law for the change in bulk composition (iron-to-silicate ratio) resulting from collisional stripping of a mantle
We find agreement between models of atmospheric chemistry changes from ionization for the 1908 Tunguska airburst event and nitrate enhancement in GISP2H and GISP2 ice cores plus an unexplained ammonium spike We then consider a candidate cometary impact at the Younger Dryas onset (YD) The large estimated NO_x production and O_3 depletion are beyond accurate extrapolation
but the ice core peak is much lower possibly because of insufficient sampling resolution Ammonium and nitrate spikes have been attributed to biomass burning at YD onset in both GRIP and GISP2 ice cores A similar result is well-resolved in Tunguska ice core data but that forest fire was far too small to account for this
Direct input of ammonia from a comet into the atmosphere is adequate for YD ice core data but not Tunguska data An analog of the Haber process with hydrogen contributed by cometary or surface water atmospheric nitrogen high pressures and possibly catalytic iron from a comet could in principle produce ammonia
During 2006 Mar - 2007 Jan we used the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the infrared emission from the ensemble of fragments meteoroids and dust tails in the more than 3 degree wide 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 debris field We also investigated contemporaneous ground based and HST observations
In 2006 May 55 fragments were detected in the Spitzer image The wide spread of fragments along the comet&#39;s orbit indicates they were formed from the 1995 splitting event While the number of major fragments in the Spitzer image is similar to that seen from the ground by optical observers
the correspondence between the fragments with optical astrometry and those seen in the Spitzer images cannot be readily established due either to strong non-gravitational terms astrometric uncertainties or transience of the fragments outgassing The Spitzer data resolve the structure of the dust comae at a resolution of 1000 km and they reveal the infrared emission due to large (mm to cm size) particles in a continuous dust trail that closely follows the projected orbit
We detect fluorescence from outflowing CO2 gas from the largest fragments (B and C) and we measure the CO2 H2O proportion (1 10 and 1 20 respectively) Three dimensionless parameters to explain dynamics of the solid particles alpha (sublimation reaction) beta (radiation pressure) and nu (ejection velocity) The major fragments have nu&gt;alpha&gt;beta and are dominated by the kinetic energy imparted to them by the fragmentation process
We recognize the need for the characterization of exoplanets in reflected light in the visible and in the IR termal emission But for the thermal infrared we also recognize the difficulty of an interferometric nuller We nevertheless endorse the need for future interferometers We propose a new realistic pathway to satisfy both goals
We give an idea and the order-of-magnitude estimations to explain the recently reported secular increase of the Astronomical Unit (AU) by Krasinsky and Brumberg (2004) The idea proposed is analogous to the tidal acceleration in the Earth-Moon system which is based on the conservation of the total angular momentum and we apply this scenario to the Sun-planets system
Assuming the existence of some tidal interactions that transfer the rotational angular momentum of the Sun and using reported value of the positive secular trend in the astronomical unit $\frac{d}{dt}{AU} = 15 \pm 4 {(m/cy)}$ the suggested change in the period of rotation of the Sun is about $21 {ms/cy}$ in the case that the orbits of the eight planets have the same &#34;expansion rate
&#34; This value is sufficiently small and at present it seems there are no observational data which exclude this possibility Effects of the change in the Sun&#39;s moment of inertia is also investigated It is pointed out that the change in the moment of inertia due to the radiative mass loss by the Sun may be responsible for the secular increase of AU
Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causal connection between the motion of the Sun through the Galaxy and terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change Proposed mechanisms include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort cloud) cosmic rays and supernovae the effects of which are modulated by the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms
Supposed periodicities in the fossil record impact cratering dates or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently cited as evidence in support of these hypotheses This remains a controversial subject with many refutations and replies having been published Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution
This necessarily includes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing Some of the studies have suffered from flaws in methodology in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr
We consider the effects of mutual transits by extrasolar planet-companion systems (in a true binary or a planet-satellite system) on light curves We show that induced changes in light curves depend strongly on a ratio between a planet-companion&#39;s orbital velocity around their host star and a planet-companion&#39;s spin speed around their common center of mass
In both the slow and fast spin cases (corresponding to long and short distances between them respectively) a certain asymmetry appears in light curves We show that especially in the case of short distances occultation of one faint object by the other while the transit of the planet-companion system occurs in front of its parent star
causes an apparent increase in light curves and characteristic fluctuations appear as important evidence of mutual transits We show also that extrasolar mutual transits provide a complementary method of measuring the radii of two transiting objects their separation and mass and consequently identifying them as a true binary planet-satellite system or others
We present a MIR coronagraph to target the direct observation of extrasolar planets for SPICA in which a coronagraph is currently regarded as an option of the focal plane instruments The primary target of the SPICA coronagraph is the direct observation of Jovian exo-planets A strategy of the baseline survey and the specifications for the coronagraph instrument for the survey are introduced together
The main wavelengths and the contrast required for the observations are 3 5-27um and 10^{-6} <a href="http //respectively Laboratory" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> experiments were performed with a visible laser to demonstrate the principles of the coronagraphs In an experiment using binary-shaped pupil coronagraphs a contrast of 6
as derived from the linear average in the dark region and the core of the PSF A coronagraph by a binary-shaped pupil mask is a baseline solution for SPICA because of its feasibility and robustness On the other hand a laboratory experiment of the phase induced amplitude apodization/binary-mask hybrid coronagraph has been executed to obtain an option of higher performance
and a contrast of 6 5x10^{-7} was achieved with active wavefront <a href="http //control Potentially" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> important by-product of the instrument transit monitoring for characteization of exo-planets is also described We also present recent progress of technology on a design of a binary-shaped pupil mask for the actual pupil of SPICA
PSF subtraction the development of free-standing binary masks a vacuum chamber and a cryogenic deformable mirror Considering SPICA to be an essential platform for coronagraphs and the progress of key technologies we propose to develop a mid-infrared coronagraph instrument for SPICA and to perform the direct observation of exo-planets with it
To date no accretion model has succeeded in reproducing all observed constraints in the inner Solar System These constraints include 1) the orbits in particular the small eccentricities and 2) the masses of the terrestrial planets -- Mars&#39; relatively small mass in particular has not been adequately reproduced in previous simulations; 3) the formation timescales of Earth and Mars
as interpreted from Hf/W isotopes; 4) the bulk structure of the asteroid belt in particular the lack of an imprint of planetary embryo-sized objects; and 5) Earth&#39;s relatively large water content assuming that it was delivered in the form of water-rich primitive asteroidal material Here we present results of 40 high-resolution (N=1000-2000) dynamical simulations of late-stage planetary accretion with the goal of reproducing these constraints
although neglecting the planet Mercury We assume that Jupiter and Saturn are fully-formed at the start of each simulation and test orbital configurations that are both consistent with and contrary to the &#34;Nice model &#34; We find that a configuration with Jupiter and Saturn on circular orbits forms low-eccentricity terrestrial planets and a water-rich Earth on the correct timescale
but Mars&#39; mass is too large by a factor of 5-10 and embryos are often stranded in the asteroid belt A configuration with Jupiter and Saturn in their current locations but with slightly higher initial eccentricities (e = 0 07-0 1) produces a small Mars an embryo-free asteroid belt and a reasonable Earth analog but rarely allows water delivery to Earth
The discovery of transiting extrasolar planets has enabled us a number of interesting stduies Transit photometry reveals the radius and the orbital inclination of transiting planets and thereby we can learn the true mass and the density of respective planets by the combined information of radial velocity measurements In addition
follow-up observations of transiting planets such as secondary eclipse transit timing variations transmission spectroscopy and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect provide us information of their dayside temperature unseen bodies in systems planetary atmospheres and obliquity of planetary orbits Such observational information which will provide us a greater understanding of extrasolar planets is available only for transiting planets
The Centaurs are a transient population of small bodies in the outer solar system whose orbits are strongly chaotic These objects typically suffer significant changes of orbital parameters on timescales of a few thousand years and their orbital evolution exhibits two types of behaviors described qualitatively as random-walk and resonance-sticking
We have analyzed the chaotic behavior of the known Centaurs Our analysis has revealed that the two types of chaotic evolution are quantitatively distinguishable (1) the random walk-type behavior is well described by so-called generalized diffusion in which the rms deviation of the semimajor axis grows with time t as ~t^H
with Hurst exponent H in the range 0 22--0 95 however (2) orbital evolution dominated by intermittent resonance sticking with sudden jumps from one mean motion resonance to another has poorly defined H We further find that these two types of behavior are correlated with Centaur dynamical lifetime most Centaurs whose dynamical lifetime is less than ~22 Myr exhibit generalized diffusion
Volatile organic emissions were detected post-perihelion in the long period comet C/2006 M4 (SWAN) in October and November 2006 Our study combines target-of-opportunity observations using the infrared Cryogenic Echelle Spectrometer (CSHELL) at the NASA-IRTF 3-m telescope and millimeter wavelength observations using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12-m telescope Five parent volatiles were measured with CSHELL (H2O
CO CH3OH CH4 and C2H6) and two additional species (HCN and CS) were measured with the ARO 12-m These revealed highly depleted CO and somewhat enriched CH3OH compared with abundances observed in the dominant group of long-period (Oort cloud) comets in our sample and similar to those observed recently in Comet 8P/Tuttle
This may indicate highly efficient H-atom addition to CO at very low temperature (~ 10 - 20 K) on the surfaces of interstellar (pre-cometary) grains Comet C/2006 M4 had nearly &#34;normal&#34; C2H6 and CH4 suggesting a processing history similar to that experienced by the dominant group When compared with estimated water production at the time of the millimeter observations
HCN was slightly depleted compared with the normal abundance in comets based on IR observations but was consistent with the majority of values from the millimeter The ratio CS/HCN in C/2006 M4 was within the range measured in ten comets at millimeter wavelengths The higher apparent H-atom conversion efficiency compared with most comets may indicate that the icy grains incorporated into C/2006 M4 were exposed to higher H-atom densities
[Abridged] To simulate the kinds of observations that will eventually be obtained for exoplanets the Deep Impact spacecraft obtained light curves of Earth at seven wavebands spanning 300-1000 nm as part of the EPOXI mission of opportunity In this paper we analyze disc-integrated light curves treating Earth as if it were an exoplanet
to determine if we can detect the presence of oceans and continents We present two observations each spanning one day taken at gibbous phases The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo variations of 15-30% with the largest relative changes occuring at the reddest wavelengths To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner we carry out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this analysis reveals that 98% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only 2 dominant eigencolors
We use the time-variations of these two eigencolors to construct longitudinal maps of the Earth treating it as a non-uniform Lambert sphere We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans; this despite the fact that our observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover
An alternative derivation of the first-order relativistic contribution to perihelic precession is presented Orbital motion in the Schwarzschild geometry is considered in the Keplerian limit and the orbit equation is derived for approximately elliptical motion The method of solution makes use of coordinate transformations and the correspondence principle rather than the standard perturbative approach
The form of the resulting orbit equation is similar to that derived from Newtonian mechanics and includes first-order corrections to Kepler&#39;s orbits due to general relativity The associated relativistic contribution to perihelic precession agrees with established first-order results The reduced radius for the circular orbit is in agreement to first-order with that calculated from the Schwarzschild effective potential
Possibilities and difficulties of applying the theory of magnetic field generation by convection flows in rotating spherical fluid shells to the Giant Planets are outlined Recent progress in the understanding of the distribution of electrical conductivity in the Giant Planets suggests that the dynamo process occurs predominantly in regions of semiconductivity
In contrast to the geodynamo the magnetic field generation in the Giant Planets is thus characterized by strong radial conductivity variations The importance of the constraint on the Ohmic dissipation provided by the planetary luminosity is emphasized Planetary dynamos are likely to be of an oscillatory type although these oscillations may not be evident from the exterior of the planets
In future high-cadence microlensing surveys planets can be detected through a new channel of an independent event produced by the planet itself The two populations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separation planets and free-floating planets Although they appear as similar short time-scale events the two populations of planets are widely different in nature and thus distinguishing them is important
In this paper we investigate the lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wide separations from host stars We find that the lensing behavior of these events is well described by the Chang-Refsdal lensing and the shear caused by the primary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contour elongated along the primary-planet axis
The elongated magnification contour implies that the light curves of these planetary events are generally asymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events from those produced by free-floating planets The asymmetry can be noticed from the overall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the very short-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic
In addition the asymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the bound nature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events The close approximation of the lensing light curve to that of the Chang-Refsdal lensing implies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information about the projected separation between the host star and the planet
We study the final architecture of planetary systems that evolve under the combined effects of planet-planet and planetesimal scattering Using N-body simulations we investigate the dynamics of marginally unstable systems of gas and ice giants both in isolation and when the planets form interior to a planetesimal belt The unstable isolated systems evolve under planet-planet scattering to yield an eccentricity distribution that matches that observed for extrasolar planets
When planetesimals are included the outcome depends upon the total mass of the planets For system masses exceeding about one Jupiter mass the final eccentricity distribution remains broad whereas for lower mass planetary systems a combination of divergent orbital evolution and recircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearly circular final orbits
We also study the fate of marginally stable multiple planet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks and find that for high planet masses the majority of such systems evolve into resonance A significant fraction lead to resonant chains that are planetary analogs of Jupiter&#39;s Galilean satellites We predict that a transition from eccentric to near-circular orbits will be observed once extrasolar planet surveys detect sub-Jovian mass planets at orbital radii of 5-10 AU
The vertical thickness of debris discs is often used as a measure of these systems&#39; dynamical excitation and as clues to the presence of hidden massive perturbers such as planetary embryos However this argument could be flawed because the observed dust should be naturally placed on inclined orbits by the combined effect of radiation pressure and mutual collisions
We critically reinvestigate this issue and numerically estimate what the &#34;natural&#34; vertical thickness of a collisionally evolving disc is in the absence of any additional perturbing body We use a deterministic collisional code following the dynamical evolution of a population of indestructible test grains suffering mutual inelastic impacts Grain differential sizes as well as the effect of radiation pressure are taken into account
We find that under the coupled effect of radiation pressure and collisions grains naturally acquire inclinations of a few degrees The disc is stratified with respect to grain sizes with the smallest grains having the largest vertical dispersion and the bigger ones clustered closer to the midplane Debris discs should have a minimum &#34;natural&#34; observed aspect ratio $h_{min}\sim 0
In this article we explore the aspect of the F ring with respect to the anti-alignment configuration between the ring and Prometheus We focus our attention on the shape of the F ring&#39;s azimuthal channels which were first reported by Porco et al (2005) and numerically explored by Murray et al
(2005) who found excellent agreement between Cassini&#39;s ISS reprojected images and their numerical model via a direct comparison We find that for anti-alignment the channels are wider and go deeper inside the ring material <br>From our numerical model we find a new feature an island in the middle of the channel
Aims We search for transiting circumbinary (CB) planets around eclipsing binaries (EBs) <br>Methods CB-BLS is a recently-introduced algorithm for the detection of transiting CB planets around <a href="http //EBs We" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> describe progress in search sensitivity generality and capability of CB-BLS and detection tests of CB-BLS on simulated data
We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS detection limits and a method for the correct detrending of intrinsically-variable stars <br>Results We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real CoRoT data The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind tests successfully
and these detections were in line with the detection limits analysis We also correctly detrend bright eclipsing binaries from observations by the TrES planet search and present some of the first results of applying CB-BLS to multiple real light curves from a wide-field survey <br>Conclusions CB-BLS is now mature enough for its application to real data
and the presented processing scheme will serve as the template for our future applications of CB-BLS to data from wide-field surveys such as CoRoT Being able to put constraints even on non-detection will help to determine the correct frequency of CB planets contributing to the understanding of planet formation in general
Still searching for transiting CB planets is still a learning experience similarly to the state of transiting planets around single stars only a few years ago The recent rapid progress in this front coupled with the exquisite quality of space-based photometry allows to realistically expect that if transiting CB planets exist - then they will soon be found
Clouds on Titan result from the condensation of methane and ethane and as on other planets are primarily structured by circulation of the atmosphere At present cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere arising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by surface heating and/or local methane sources
and at the north (winter) pole resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the colder troposphere General circulation models predict that this distribution should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale and that clouds should develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes (~40\degree) in the winter hemisphere
The models however have hitherto been poorly constrained and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general agreement with the models confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled by the global circulation The non-detection of clouds at latitude ~40\degree N and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending are
CoRoT-2a is a young (about 0 5 Gyr) G7V star accompanied by a transiting hot-Jupiter discovered by the CoRoT satellite (Alonso et al 2008; Bouchy et al 2008) An analysis of its photospheric activity based on spot modelling techniques previously developed by our group for the analysis of the Sun as a star
shows that the active regions on CoRoT-2a arised within two active longitudes separated by about 180 degrees and rotating with periods of 4 5221 and 4 5543 days respectively at epoch of CoRoT observations (112 continous days centered at 2007 6) We show that the total spotted area oscillates with a period of about about 8
a value close to 10 times the synodic period of the planet with respect to the active longitude pattern rotating in 4 5221 days Moreover the variance of the stellar flux is modulated in phase with the planet orbital period This suggests a possible star-planet magnetic interaction a phenomenon already seen in other extrasolar planetary systems hosting hot-Jupiters
We introduce and describe our newly developed code that simulates light curves and radial velocity curves for arbitrary transiting exoplanets with a satellite The most important feature of the program is the calculation of radial velocity curves and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in such systems We discuss the possibilities for detecting the exomoons taking the abilities of Extremely Large Telescopes into account
We report a possible change in the orbit parameters of the TrES-2 exoplanet With a period of 2 470621 days the TrES-2 exoplanet exhibits almost &#34;grazing&#34; transits 110 4 minutes duration as measured in 2006 by Holman and collaborators We observed two transits of TrES-2 in 2008 using the 1
A careful light curve analysis including a re-analysis of the 2006 observations shows that the current transit duration has shortened since 2006 by ~ 3 16 minutes Although the new observations were taken in a different filter we argue that the observed change in transit duration time cannot be attributed to the treatment of limb darkening
Instabilities of the dust layer in a protoplanetary disk are investigated It is known that the streaming instability develops and dust density concentration occurs in a situation where the initial dust density is uniform This work considers the effect of initial dust density gradient vertical to the midplane Dust and gas are treated as different fluids
Pressure of dust fluid is assumed to be zero The gas friction time is assumed to be constant Axisymmetric two-dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the spectral method We found that an instability develops with a growth rate on the order of the Keplerian angular velocity even if the gas friction time multiplied by the Keplerian angular velocity is as small as 0
<br>This instability is powered by two sources (1) the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity and (2) the relative motion of dust and gas coupled with the dust density fluctuation due to advection This instability diffuses dust by turbulent advection and the maximum dust density decreases This means that the dust concentration by the streaming instability which is seen in the case of a uniform initial dust density becomes ineffective as dust density gradient increases by the dust settling toward the midplane
We recently reported on the detection of a possible planetary-mass companion to Beta Pictoris at a projected separation of 8 AU from the star using data taken in November 2003 with NaCo the adaptive-optics system installed on the Very Large Telescope UT4 Eventhough no second epoch detection was available there are strong arguments to favor a gravitationally bound companion rather than a background object
If confirmed and located at a physical separation of 8 AU this young hot (~1500 K) massive Jovian companion (~8 Mjup) would be the closest planet to its star ever imaged could be formed via core-accretion and could explain the main morphological and dynamical properties of the dust disk Our goal was to return to Beta Pic five years later to obtain a second-epoch observation of the companion or
in case of a non-detection constrain its orbit Deep adaptive-optics L&#39;-band direct images of Beta Pic and Ks-band Four-Quadrant-Phase-Mask (4QPM) coronagraphic images were recorded with NaCo in January and February 2009 We also use 4QPM data taken in November 2004 No point-like signal with the brightness of the companion candidate (apparent magnitudes L&#39;=11
As expected the non-detection does not allow to rule out a background object; however we show that it is consistent with the orbital motion of a bound companion that got closer to the star since first observed in 2003 and that is just emerging from behind the star at the present epoch
In this paper we present and discuss the criteria for selecting potential target stars suitable for the search for Earth like planets with a special emphasis on the stellar aspects of habitability Missions that search for terrestrial exoplanets will explore the presence and habitability of Earth-like exoplanets around several hundred nearby stars
mainly F G K and M stars The evaluation of the list of potential target systems in order to develop mission concepts for a search for Terrestrial Exoplanets is essential Using the Darwin All Sky Star Catalogue (DASSC) we discuss the selection criteria configuration dependent sub-catalogues and the implication of stellar activity for habitability
Propagation of relativistic particles in the Schwarzschild gravitational field is studied Particles emitted radially outward with speed at infinity exceeding c/2^0 5 are observed to be accelerated in the gravitational field by a distant observer This is the Shapiro effect for relativistic particles Slower particles are decelerated as in Newtonian gravity
A speed-dependent potential for relativistic particles corresponding to the speed measured in terms of the coordinate time is derived to be $V=GM gamma(gamma^2 -2)/r which is repulsive for v&gt;c/2^0 5 The gravitational repulsion could be revealed in satellite experiments with beams of relativistic particles subject to very precise time measurements
HR8799 is a nearby A-type star with a debris disk and three planetary candidates recently imaged directly We undertake a coherent analysis of various portions of observational data on all known components of the system The goal is to elucidate the architecture and evolutionary status of the system We try to further constrain the age and orientation of the system
orbits and masses of the companions as well as the location of dust From the high luminosity of debris dust and dynamical constraints we argue for a rather young system&#39;s age of &lt;50Myr The system must be seen nearly but not exactly pole-on Our analysis of the stellar rotational velocity yields an inclination of 13-30deg
whereas i&gt;20deg is needed for the system to be dynamically stable which suggests a probable inclination range of 20-30deg The spectral energy distribution is naturally reproduced with two dust rings associated with two planetesimal belts The inner &#34;asteroid belt&#34; is located at ~10AU inside the orbit of the innermost companion and a &#34;Kuiper belt&#34; at &gt;100AU is just exterior to the orbit of the outermost companion
The dust masses in the inner and outer ring are estimated to be ~1E-05 and 4E-02 M_earth respectively We show that all three planetary candidates may be stable in the mass range suggested in the discovery paper by Marois et al 2008 (between 5 and 13 Jupiter masses) but only for some of all possible orientations
We present three-dimensional solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations in the co-rotating frame of reference outside a magnetized rigidly rotating cylinder We make no symmetry assumption for the magnetic field but to be able to make analytical progress we neglect outflows and specify a particular form for the current density The magnetohydrostatic equations can then be reduced to a single linear partial differential equation for a pseudo-potential $U$
from which the magnetic field can be calculated by differentiation The equation for $U$ can be solved by standard methods The solutions can also be used to determine the plasma pressure density and temperature as functions of all three spatial coordinates Despite the obvious limitations of this approach it can for example be used as a simple tool to create three-dimensional models for the closed field line regions of rotating magnetospheres without rotational symmetry
Context Protoplanetary disks are observed to remain dust-rich for up to several million years Theoretical modeling on the other hand raises several questions Firstly dust coagulation occurs so rapidly that if the small dust grains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates most disks should be observed to be dust poor
which is not the case Secondly if dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters they drift so fast inwards that they are quickly lost <br>Aims We attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates is effective enough to keep disks &#39;dusty&#39; by replenishing the population of small grains and by preventing excessive radial drift
<br>Methods With a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation and fragmentation modeling code we solve the combined problem of coagulation fragmentation turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve for the 1-D viscous gas disk evolution <br>Results We find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s
as suggested by laboratory experiments the fragmentation is so effective that at all times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles This means that radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particles remain present for a few million years as observed For a critical velocity of 10 m/s
Simulations of Titan&#39;s atmospheric transmission and surface reflectivity have been developed in order to estimate how Titan&#39;s atmosphere and surface properties could affect performances of the Cassini radar experiment In this paper we present a selection of models for Titan&#39;s haze vertical rain distribution and surface composition implemented in our simulations
We collected dielectric constant values for the Cassini radar wavelength ($\sim 2 2$ cm) for materials of interest for Titan liquid methane liquid mixture of methane-ethane water ice and light hydrocarbon ices Due to the lack of permittivity values for Titan&#39;s haze particles in the microwave range we performed dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_r$) measurements around 2
We obtained a real part of $\varepsilon_r$ in the range of 2-2 5 and a loss tangent between $10^{-3}$ and $5 10^{-2}$ By combining aerosol distribution models (with hypothetical condensation at low altitudes) to surface models we find the following results (1) Aerosol-only atmospheres should cause no loss and are essentially transparent for Cassini radar
as expected by former analysis (2) However if clouds are present some atmospheric models generate significant attenuation that can reach $-50 dB$ well below the sensitivity threshold of the receiver In such cases a $13 78 GHz$ radar would not be able to measure echoes coming from the surface We thus warn about possible risks of misinterpretation if a \textquotedblleft wet atmosphere\textquotedblright $ $is not taken into account
In this paper we investigate the detectability of a habitable-zone exomoon around various configurations of exoplanetary systems with the Kepler Mission or photometry of approximately equal quality We calculate both the predicted transit timing signal amplitudes and the estimated uncertainty on such measurements in order to calculate the confidence in detecting such bodies across a broad spectrum of orbital arrangements
The effects of stellar variability instrument noise and photon noise are all accounted for in the analysis We validate our methodology by simulating synthetic lightcurves and performing a Monte Carlo analysis for several cases of interest <br>We find that habitable-zone exomoons down to 0 2 Earth masses may be detected and ~25
The presence of a stellar companion closer than ~100 AU is likely to affect planet formation and evolution Yet the precise effects and their actual impact on planet occurrence are still debated To bring observational constraints we have conducted with VLT/NACO a systematic adaptive optics survey for close stellar companions to 130 solar-type stars with and without planets
In this paper we present observational and preliminary statistical results from this survey Observational results reveal about 20 true companions of which 4 are new companions to planet-host stars As to preliminary statistical results they suggest that circumstellar giant planets are less frequent in binaries closer than ~100 AU than around single stars
The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) period is the narrow time interval between 3 8 and 3 9 Gyr ago where the bulk of the craters we see on the Moon formed Even more craters formed on the Earth <br>During a field expedition to the 3 8 Gyr old Isua greenstone belt in Greenland
we sampled three types of metasedimentary rocks that contain direct traces of the LHB impactors by a seven times enrichment (150 ppt) in iridium compared to present day ocean crust (20 ppt) <br>We show that this enrichment is in agreement with the lunar cratering rate providing the impactors were comets
but not if they were asteroids Our study is a first direct indication of the nature of the LHB impactors and the first to find an agreement between the LHB lunar cratering rate and the Earth&#39;s early geochemical record (and the corresponding lunar record) <br>The LHB comets that delivered the iridium we see at Isua will at the same time have delivered the equivalent of a km deep ocean
The spatial origin and detectability of rotational H2O emission lines from Herbig Ae type protoplanetary disks beyond 70 micron is discussed We use the recently developed disk code ProDiMo to calculate the thermo-chemical structure of a Herbig Ae type disk and apply the non-LTE line radiative transfer code Ratran to predict water line profiles and intensity maps
The model shows three spatially distinct regions in the disk where water concentrations are high related to different chemical pathways to form the water (1) a big water reservoir in the deep midplane behind the inner rim (2) a belt of cold water around the distant icy midplane beyond the snow-line r&gt;20AU
and (3) a layer of irradiated hot water at high altitudes z/r=0 1 0 3 extending from about 1AU to 30AU where the kinetic gas temperature ranges from 200K to 1500K Although region 3 contains only little amounts of water vapour (~3x10^-5 M_Earth) we find this warm layer to be almost entirely responsible for the rotational water emission lines
execpt for the 3 lowest excitation lines Thus Herschel will probe first and foremost the conditions and radial extension of region 3 where water is predominantly formed via neutral-neutral reactions and the gas is thermally decoupled from the dust T_gas&gt;T_dust The observations do not allow for a determination of the snow-line
because the snow-line truncates the radial extension of region 1 whereas the lines originate from region 3 Different line transfer approximations (LTE escape probability Monte Carlo) are discussed A non-LTE treatment is required in most cases and the results obtained with the escape probability method are found to underestimate the Monte Carlo results by 2%
Anderson &amp; Schubert (2007 Science 317 1384) proposed that Saturn&#39;s rotation period can be ascertained by minimizing the dynamic heights of the 100 mbar isosurface with respect to the geoid; they derived a rotation period of 10h 32m 35s We investigate the same approach for Jupiter to see if the Jovian rotation period is predicted by minimizing the dynamical heights of its isobaric (1 bar pressure level) surface using zonal wind data
A rotation period of 9h 54m 29s is found Further we investigate the minimization method by fitting Pioneer and Voyager occultation radii for both Jupiter and Saturn Rotation periods of 9h 55m 30s and 10h 32m 35s are found to minimize the dynamical heights for Jupiter and Saturn respectively Though there is no dynamical principle requiring the minimization of the dynamical heights of an isobaric surface
the successful application of the method to Jupiter lends support to its relevance for Saturn We derive Jupiter and Saturn rotation periods using equilibrium theory in which the solid-body rotation period (no winds) that gives the observed equatorial and polar radii at the 100 mbar level is found Rotation periods of 9h 55m 20s and 10h 31m 49s are found for Jupiter and Saturn
respectively We show that both Jupiter&#39;s and Saturn&#39;s shapes can be derived using solid-body rotation suggesting that zonal winds have a minor effect on the planetary shape for both planets The agreement in the values of Saturn&#39;s rotation period predicted by the different approaches supports the conclusion that the planet&#39;s period of rotation is about 10h 32m
Our current understanding of split Jupiter-family comets is reviewed The focus is on what recent studies of comets have told us about the nature of the splitting phenomenon The goal is to not repeat the information given in recent reviews of split comets but to build upon it In particular
we discuss comets that have suffered splitting or fragmentation events in the past few years These include comets (a) 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte observed with a long train of fragments in 2002; (b) 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 which split in 1995 and was extensively studied during its relatively close passage to Earth in 2006
during which dozens of fragments were discovered and studied; and (c) 174P/Echeclus a Centaur and potentially future JFC which split in late 2005 and was the first such Centaur observed to do so We also discuss recent observations by SOHO of split comets that are likely of short-period The Spitzer Space Telescope has observed many JFCs and provided us with unprecedented detailed views of cometary debris trails
We review Fermi&#39;s paradox (or the &#34;Great Silence&#34; problem) not only arguably the oldest and crucial problem for the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI) but also a conundrum of profound scientific philosophical and cultural importance By a simple analysis of observation selection effects the correct resolution of Fermi&#39;s paradox is certain to tell us something about the future of humanity
Already a more than three quarters of a century old puzzle - and a quarter of century since the last major review paper in the field by G David Brin - Fermi&#39;s paradox has generated many ingenious discussions and hypotheses We analyze the often tacit methodological assumptions built into various answers to this puzzle and attempt a new classification of the numerous solutions proposed in an already huge literature on the subject
Recent years have shown many advances in our knowledge of the collisional evolution of protoplanetary dust Based on a variety of dust-collision experiments in the laboratory our view of the growth of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks is now supported by a deeper understanding of the physics involved in the interaction between dust agglomerates
However the parameter space which determines the collisional outcome is huge and sometimes inaccessible to laboratory experiments Very large or fluffy dust aggregates and extremely low collision velocities are beyond the boundary of today&#39;s laboratories It is therefore desirable to augment our empirical knowledge of dust-collision physics with a numerical method to treat arbitrary aggregate sizes
porosities and collision velocities In this article we implement experimentally-determined material parameters of highly porous dust aggregates into a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code in particular an omnidirectional compressive-strength and a tensile-strength relation We also give a prescription of calibrating the SPH code with compression and low-velocity impact experiments In the process of calibration
we developed a dynamic compressive-strength relation and estimated a relation for the shear strength Finally we defined and performed a series of benchmark tests and found the agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations to be very satisfactory SPH codes have been used in the past to study collisions at rather high velocities
The equation of state calculated by Saumon and collaborators has been adopted in most core-accretion simulations of giant-planet formation performed to date Since some minor errors have been found in their original paper we present revised simulations of giant-planet formation that considers a corrected equation of state We employ the same code as Fortier and collaborators in repeating our previous simulations of the formation of Jupiter
Although the general conclusions of Fortier and collaborators remain valid we obtain significantly lower core masses and shorter formation times in all cases considered The minor errors in the previously published equation of state have been shown to affect directly the adiabatic gradient and the specific heat causing an overestimation of both the core masses and formation times
The statistical properties of circumstellar disks around young stars are important for constraining theoretical models for the formation and early evolution of planetary systems In this brief review I survey the literature related to ground-based and Spitzer-based infrared (IR) studies of young stellar clusters with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of primordial (``protoplanetary&#39;&#39;) disks through spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics
The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars with optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic evidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay with characteristic time ~2 5 Myr (half-life = 1 7 Myr) Large IR surveys of ~2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter in the observed disk fractions as a function of age
Recent Spitzer surveys have found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and environment (binarity proximity to massive stars and cluster density) Perhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars the disk fraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass ranging from ~1 Myr for &gt;1
A global Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of published eclipse photometry and radial velocities is presented for the transiting planet HD 80606b Despite the lack of a complete transit light curve the size of the planet is measured with a good level of precision (R_p = 1 04 +0 05-0
while the orbital parameters are refined This global analysis reveals that the orbital axis of the planet is significatively inclined relative to the spin axis of the host star (Beta = -59 +18-28 deg) providing a compelling evidence that HD 80606b owes its peculiar orbit to the Kozai migration mechanism
We present VLT eclipse photometry for the giant planet CoRoT-1b We observed a transit in the R-band filter and an occultation in a narrow filter centered on 2 09 microns Our analysis of this new photometry and published radial velocities in combination with stellar-evolutionary modeling leads to a planetary mass and radius of 1
-0 18) M_Jup and 1 45 (+0 07 -0 13) R_Jup confirming the very low density previously deduced from CoRoT photometry The large occultation depth that we measure at 2 09 microns (0 278 (+0 043 -0 066) %) is consistent with thermal emission and is better reproduced by an atmospheric model with no redistribution of the absorbed stellar flux to the night side of the planet
We present the systemic Console a new all-in-one general-purpose software package for the analysis and combined multiparameter fitting of Doppler radial velocity (RV) and transit timing observations We give an overview of the computational algorithms implemented in the Console and describe the tools offered for streamlining the characterization of planetary systems
We illustrate the capabilities of the package by analyzing an updated radial velocity data set for the HD128311 planetary system HD128311 harbors a pair of planets that appear to be participating in a 2 1 mean motion resonance We show that the dynamical configuration cannot be fully determined from the current data
We examine the radius evolution of close-in giant planets with a planet evolution model that couples the orbital-tidal and thermal evolution For 45 transiting systems we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths forward in time starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes and eccentricities Given observational constraints at the current time for a given planet (semi-major axis
eccentricity and system age) we find possible evolutionary paths that match these constraints and compare the calculated radii to observations We find that tidal evolution has two effects First planets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis allowing them to contract more efficiently at earlier times Second tidal heating can significantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized
but this effect on the radius is short-lived thereafter Often circularization of the orbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases Some systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with our coupled model are HAT-P-7 HAT-P-9 WASP-10 and XO-4 This increases the number of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many as 35 for our standard case
but for some of these systems we are required to be viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation This is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism to explain most inflated radii Also large initial eccentricities would have to be common
The probability that an existing planetary transit is detectable in one&#39;s data is sensitively dependent upon the window function of the observations We quantitatively characterize and provide visualizations of the dependence of this probability as a function of orbital period upon several observing strategy and astrophysical parameters such as length of observing run
observing cadence length of night transit duration and depth and the minimum number of sampled transits The ability to detect a transit is directly related to the intrinsic noise of the observations In our simulations of observational window functions we explicitly address non-correlated (gaussian or white) noise and correlated (red) noise and discuss how these two noise components affect transit detectability in fundamentally different manners
The transiting planet CoRoT-1b is thought to belong to the pM-class of planets in which the thermal emission dominates in the optical wavelengths We present a detection of its secondary eclipse in the CoRoT white channel data whose response function goes from ~400 to ~1000 nm We used two different filtering approaches
and several methods to evaluate the significance of a detection of the secondary eclipse We detect a secondary eclipse centered within 20 min at the expected times for a circular orbit with a depth of 0 016+/-0 006% The center of the eclipse is translated in a 1-sigma upper limit to the planet&#39;s eccentricity of ecosomega&lt;0
Under the assumption of a zero Bond Albedo and blackbody emission from the planet it corresponds to a T_{CoRoT}=2330 +120-140 K We provide the equilibrium temperatures of the planet as a function of the amount of reflected light If the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the incident flux from the star
Current theories on planetary formation establish that giant planet formation should be contextual to their quick migration towards the central star due to the protoplanets-disc interactions on a timescale of the order of $10^5$ years for objects of nearly 10 terrestrial masses Such a timescale should be smaller by an order of magnitude than that of gas accretion onto the protoplanet during the hierarchical growing-up of protoplanets by collisions with other minor objects
These arguments have recently been analysed using N-body and/or fluid-dynamics codes or a mixing of them In this work inviscid 2D simulations are performed using the SPH method to study the migration of one protoplanet to evaluate the effectiveness of the accretion disc in the protoplanet dragging towards the central star
as a function of the mass of the planet itself of disc tangential kinematics To this purpose the SPH scheme is considered suitable to study the roles of turbulence kinematic and boundary conditions due to its intrinsic advective turbulence especially in 2D and in 3D codes Simulations are performed both in disc sub-Keplerian and in Keplerian kinematic conditions as a parameter study of protoplanetary migration if moderate and consistent deviations from Keplerian Kinematics occur
Our results show migration times of a few orbital periods for Earth-like planets in sub-Keplerian conditions while for Jupiter-like planets estimates give that about $10^4$ orbital periods are needed to half the orbital size Timescales of planet migration are strongly dependent on the relative position of the planet with respect to the shock region near the centrifugal barrier of the disc flow
We report on the discovery of a substellar companion or a massive Jupiter orbiting the G5V star HD16760 with the spectrograph SOPHIE installed on the OHP 1 93-m telescope Characteristics and performances of the spectrograph are presented as well as the SOPHIE exoplanet consortium program With a minimum mass of 14
We consider statistics of the disruption and Lyapunov times in an hierarchical restricted three-body problem We show that at the edge of disruption the orbital periods and the size of the orbit of the escaping body exhibit Lévy flights Due to them the time decay of the survival probability is heavy-tailed with the power-law index equal to -2/3
We present radial-velocity sequences acquired during three transits of the exoplanet HD 189733b and one transit of the CoRoT-3b We applied a combined Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data on these stars to determine a full set of system parameters including the project spin-orbit misalignement angle of HD 189733b to an unprecedented precision via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
beta = 0 85 degrees (+0 32 -0 28) This small but non-zero inclination of the planetary orbit is important to understand the origin of the system On CoRoT-3b results seem to point towards a non-zero inclination as well with beta = 37 6 degrees (+10 0 -22 3) but this remains marginal
During close angular approaches of solar system planets to astrometric radio sources the apparent positions of these sources shift due to relativistic effects and thus these events may be used for testing the theory of general relativity; this fact was successfully demonstrated in the experiments on the measurements of radio source position shifts during the approaches of Jupiter carried out in 1988 and 2002
An analysis performed within the frames of the present work showed that when a source is observed near a planet&#39;s disk edge i e practically in the case of occultation the current experimental accuracy makes it possible to measure the relativistic effects for all planets However radio occultations are fairly rare events
At the same time only Jupiter and Saturn provide noticeable relativistic effects approaching the radio sources at angular distances of about a few planet radii Our analysis resulted in the creation of a catalog of forthcoming occultations and approaches of planets to astrometric radio sources for the time period of 2008-2050
Radio astrometry of nearby low-mass stars has the potential to be a powerful tool for the discovery and characterization of planetary companions We present a Very Large Array survey of 172 active M dwarfs at distances of less than 10 pc Twenty nine stars were detected with flux densities greater than 100 microJy
We observed 7 of these stars with the Very Long Baseline Array at milliarcsecond resolution in three separate epochs With a detection threshold of 500 microJy in images of sensitivity 1 sigma ~ 100 microJy we detected three stars three times (GJ 65B GJ896A GJ 4247) one star twice (GJ 285)
and one star once (GJ 803) Two stars were undetected (GJ 412B and GJ 1224) For the four stars detected in multiple epochs residuals from the optically-determined proper motions have an rms deviation of ~0 2 milliarcseconds consistent with statistical noise limits Combined with previous optical astrometry these residuals provide acceleration upper limits that allow us to exclude planetary companions more massive than 3-6 M_Jup at a distance of ~1 AU with a 99% confidence level
We investigate the problem of the typical rotation states of the small planetary satellites from the viewpoint of the dynamical stability of their rotation We show that the majority of the discovered satellites with unknown rotation periods cannot rotate synchronously because no stable synchronous 1 1 spin-orbit state exists for them
Detectable debris discs are thought to require dynamical excitation (`stirring&#39;) so that planetesimal collisions release large quantities of dust We investigate the effects of the secular perturbations of a planet which may lie at a significant distance from the planetesimal disc to see if these perturbations can stir the disc
and if so over what time-scale The secular perturbations cause orbits at different semi-major axes to precess at different rates and after some time t_cross initially non-intersecting orbits begin to cross We show that t_cross is proportional to a_disc^(9/2)/(m_pl e_pl a_pl^3) where m_pl e_pl and a_pl are the mass eccentricity
and semi-major axis of the planet and a_disc is the semi-major axis of the disc This time-scale can be faster than that for the growth of planetesimals to Pluto&#39;s size within the outer disc We also calculate the magnitude of the relative velocities induced amongst planetesimals and infer that a planet&#39;s perturbations can typically cause destructive collisions out to 100&#39;s of AU
Recently formed planets can thus have a significant impact on planet formation in the outer disc which may be curtailed by the formation of giant planets much closer to the star The presence of an observed debris disc does not require the presence of Pluto-sized objects within it since it can also have been stirred by a planet not in the disc
Context CoRoT is a pioneering space mission devoted to the analysis of stellar variability and the photometric detection of extrasolar planets <br>Aims We present the list of planetary transit candidates detected in the first field observed by CoRoT IRa01 the initial run toward the Galactic anticenter which lasted for 60 days
<br>Methods We analysed 3898 sources in the coloured bands and 5974 in the monochromatic band Instrumental noise and stellar variability were taken into account using detrending tools before applying various transit search algorithms <br>Results Fifty sources were classified as planetary transit candidates and the most reliable 40 detections were declared targets for follow-up ground-based observations
We investigate the intensity and polarization of reflected light from planetary atmospheres We present a large grid of Monte Carlo simulations for planets with Rayleigh scattering atmospheres We discuss the disk-integrated polarization for phase angles typical of extrasolar planet observations and for the limb polarization effect observable for solar system objects near opposition
The main parameters investigated are single scattering albedo optical depth of the scattering layer and albedo of an underlying Lambert surface for a homogeneous Rayleigh scattering atmosphere We also investigate atmospheres with isotropic scattering and forward scattering aerosol particles as well as models with two scattering layers <br>The model grid provides a tool for extracting quantitative results from polarimetric measurements of planetary atmospheres from solar system planets and extrasolar planets
in particular on the scattering properties and stratification of particles in the highest atmosphere layers Spectropolarimetry of solar system planets offers complementary information to spectroscopy and polarization flux colors can be used for a first characterization of exoplanet atmospheres From limb polarization measurements one can set constraints on the polarization at large phase angles
We report on the discovery of a planetary system with a close-in transiting hot Jupiter on a near circular orbit and a massive outer planet on a highly eccentric orbit The inner planet HAT-P-13b transits the bright V=10 622 G4 dwarf star GSC 3416-00543 every P = 2 916260 \pm 0
with transit epoch Tc = 2454779 92979 \pm 0 00038 (BJD) and duration 0 1345 \pm 0 0017 d The outer planet HAT-P-13c orbits the star with P2 = 428 5 \pm 3 0 days and nominal transit center (assuming zero impact parameter) of T2c = 2454870 4 \pm 1
peri= 2454890 05 \pm 0 48 (BJD) Transits of the outer planet have not been observed and may not be present The host star has a mass of 1 22 \pm ^0 05_0 10 Msun radius of 1 56 \pm 0 08 Rsun effective temperature 5653 \pm 90 K and is rather metal rich with [Fe=H] = +0
The inner planetary companion has a mass of 0 853\pm ^0 029_-0 046MJup and radius of 1 281 \pm 0 079 RJup yielding a mean density of 0 498\pm +0 103_-0 069 gcm^-3 The outer companion has m2 sini2 = 15 2 \pm 1 0 MJup and orbits on a highly eccentric orbit of e2 = 0
While we have not detected significant transit timing variations of HAT-P-13b due to gravitational and light-travel time effects future observations will constrain the orbital inclination of HAT-P-13c along with its mutual inclination to HAT-P-13b The HAT-P-13 (b c) double-planet system may prove extremely valuable for theoretical studies of the formation and dynamics of planetary systems
The dynamics of planetesimals and planetary cores may be strongly influenced by density perturbations driven by magneto-rotational turbulence in their natal protoplanetary gas disks Using the local shearing box approximation we perform numerical simulations of planetesimals moving as massless particles in a turbulent magnetized unstratified gas disk Our fiducial disk model shows turbulent accretion characterized by a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter of $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$
with root-mean-square density perturbations of $\sim$10% We measure the statistical evolution of particle orbital properties in our simulations including mean radius eccentricity and velocity dispersion We confirm random walk growth in time of all three properties the first time that this has been done with direct orbital integration in a local model
We find that the growth rate increases with the box size used at least up to boxes of eight scale heights in horizontal size However even our largest boxes show velocity dispersions sufficiently low that collisional destruction of planetesimals should be unimportant in the inner disk throughout its lifetime Our direct integrations agree with earlier torque measurements showing that type I migration dominates over diffusive migration by stochastic torques for most objects in the planetary core and terrestrial planet mass range
On June 15 2009 UT the transit of TrES-2b was detected using the University of Arizona&#39;s 1 55 meter Kuiper Telescope with 2 0-2 5 millimag RMS accuracy in the I-band We find a central transit time of $T_c = 2454997 76286 \pm0 00035$ HJD an orbital period of $P = 2
and an inclination angle of $i = 83^{\circ} 92 \pm 0 05$ which is consistent with our re-fit of the original I-band light curve of O&#39;Donovan et al (2006) where we find $i = 83^{\circ} 84 \pm0 05$ We calculate an insignificant inclination change of $\Delta i = -0^{\circ} 08 \pm 0
and as such our observations rule out at the $\sim 11 \sigma$ level the apparent change of orbital inclination to $i_{predicted} = 83^{\circ} 35 \pm0 1$ as predicted by Mislis and Schmitt (2009) and Mislis et al (2010) for our epoch Moreover our analysis of a recently published Kepler Space Telescope light curve (Gilliland et al
We analyze OGLE-2007-BLG-050 a high magnification microlensing event (A ~ 432) whose peak occurred on 2 May 2007 with pronounced finite-source and parallax effects We compute planet detection efficiencies for this event in order to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lens star Both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of the angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0
leading to an estimate of the lens mass M = 0 50 +/- 0 14 M_Sun and its distance to the observer D_L = 5 5 +/- 0 4 kpc This is only the second determination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolated unseen object using any method
This allows us to calculate the planetary detection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp m_p) where r_\perp is the projected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass When computing planet detection efficiency we did not find any planetary signature and our detection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to Neptune-mass planets
and to a lesser extent Earth-mass planets in some configurations Indeed Jupiter and Neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidence for a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star respectively [0 6 - 10] and [1 4 - 4] AU and Earth-mass planets are excluded with a 10% confidence in the lensing zone
We have performed a simulation of a next generation sky survey&#39;s (Pan-STARRS 1) efficiency for detecting Earth-impacting asteroids The steady-state sky-plane distribution of the impactors long before impact is concentrated towards small solar elongations (Chesley and Spahr 2004) but we find that there is interesting and potentially exploitable behavior in the sky-plane distribution in the months leading up to impact
The next generation surveys will find most of the dangerous impactors (&gt;140m diameter) during their decade-long survey missions though there is the potential to miss difficult objects with long synodic periods appearing in the direction of the Sun as well as objects with long orbital periods that spend much of their time far from the Sun and Earth
A space-based platform that can observe close to the Sun may be needed to identify many of the potential impactors that spend much of their time interior to the Earth&#39;s orbit The next generation surveys have a good chance of imaging a bolide like 2008TC3 before it enters the atmosphere but the difficulty will lie in obtaining enough images in advance of impact to allow an accurate pre-impact orbit to be computed
Due to close encounters with the inner planets Near-Earth-Asteroids (NEAs) can have very chaotic orbits Because of this chaoticity a statistical treatment of the dynamical properties of NEAs becomes difficult or even impossible We propose a new way to classify NEAs by using methods from Fuzzy Logic We demonstrate how a fuzzy characterization of NEAs can be obtained and how a subsequent analysis can deliver valid and quantitative results concerning the long-term dynamics of NEAs
We report the discovery of very shallow (DF/F = 3 4 10-4) periodic dips in the light curve of an active V = 11 7 G9V star observed by the CoRoT satellite which we interpret as due to the presence of a transiting companion We describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and complementary ground-based observations that support the planetary nature of the companion
Methods We use CoRoT color information good angular resolution ground-based photometric observations in- and out- of transit adaptive optics imaging near-infrared spectroscopy and preliminary results from Radial Velocity measurements to test the diluted eclipsing binary scenarios The parameters of the host star are derived from optical spectra which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive parameters of the companion
We examine carefully all conceivable cases of false positives and all tests performed support the planetary hypothesis Blends with separation larger than 0 40 arcsec or triple systems are almost excluded with a 8 10-4 risk left We conclude that as far as we have been exhaustive we have discovered a planetary companion
named CoRoT-7b for which we derive a period of 0 853 59 +/- 3 10-5 day and a radius of Rp = 1 68 +/- 0 09 REarth Analysis of preliminary radial velocity data yields an upper limit of 21 MEarth for the companion mass supporting the finding <br>CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a measured radius
We present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009 June 5 transit of the exoplanet HD 80606b We report the first detection of the transit ingress revealing the transit duration to be 11 64 +/- 0 25 hr and allowing more robust determinations of the system parameters
Keck spectra obtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift giving definitive evidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned The Keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 deg with 68 3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99 73% confidence Thus the orbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0
but is also tilted away from the equatorial plane of its parent star A large tilt had been predicted based on the idea that the planet&#39;s eccentric orbit was caused by the Kozai mechanism Independently of the theory it is noteworthy that all 3 exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planets on eccentric orbits
We report the discovery from WASP-South of a new Jupiter-like extrasolar planet WASP-16b which transits its solar analog host star every 3 12 days Analysis of the transit photometry and radial velocity spectroscopic data leads to a planet with R_p = 1 008+-0 071 R_Jup and M_p =0 855+-0 059 M_Jup
orbiting a host star with R_* = 0 946+-0 054 R_sun and M_* = 1 022+-0 101 M_sun Comparison of the high resolution stellar spectrum with synthetic spectra and stellar evolution models indicates the host star is a near-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]= 0 01+-0 10) solar analog (Teff = 5700+-150 K
We present time series Doppler data from Lick Observatory that reveal the presence of long-period planetary companions orbiting nearby stars The typical eccentricity of these massive planets are greater than the mean eccentricity of known exoplanets HD30562b has Msini = 1 29 Mjup with semi-major axis of 2 3 AU and eccentricity 0
The host star has a spectral type F8V and is metal rich HD86264b has Msini = 7 0 Mjup arel = 2 86 AU an eccentricity e = 0 7 and orbits a metal-rich F7V star HD87883b has Msini = 1 78 Mjup arel = 3 6 AU e = 0
HD89307b has Msini = 1 78 Mjup arel = 3 3 AU e = 0 24 and orbits a G0V star with slightly subsolar metallicity HD148427b has Msini = 0 96 Mjup arel = 0 93 AU eccentricity of 0 16 and orbits a metal rich K0 subgiant We also present velocities for a planet orbiting the F8V metal-rich binary star
Context The CoRoT satellite searches for planets by applying the transit method monitoring up to 12 000 stars in the galactic plane for 150 days in each observation run This search is contaminated by a large fraction of false positives caused by different binary configurations that might be confused with a transiting planet
Aims We evaluate the rates and nature of false positives in the CoRoT exoplanets search and compare our results with semiempirical predictions Methods We consider the detected binary and planet candidates in the first three extended CoRoT runs and classify the results of the follow-up observations completed to verify their planetary nature
We group the follow-up results into undiluted binaries diluted binaries and planets and compare their abundances with predictions from the literature Results 83% of the initial detections are classified as false positives using only the CoRoT light-curves the remaining 17% require follow-up observations Finally 12% of the follow-up candidates are planets
The shape of the overall distribution of the false positive rate follows previous predictions except for candidates with transit depths below about 0 4% For candidates with transit depths in the range from 0 1 - 0 4% CoRoT detections are nearly complete and this difference from predictions is probably real and dominated by a lower than expected abundance of diluted eclipsing binaries
We show that the assembly of the Solar System terrestrial planets can be successfully modelled with all of the mass initially confined to a narrow annulus between 0 7 and 1 0 AU With this configuration analogues of Mercury and Mars often form from the collisional evolution of material diffusing out of the annulus under the scattering of the forming Earth and Venus analogues
The final systems also possess eccentricities and inclinations that match the observations without recourse to dynamical friction from remnant small body populations Finally the characteristic assembly timescale for Earth analogues is rapid in this model and consistent with cosmochemical models based on the $^{182}$Hf--$^{182}$W isotopes The agreement between this model and the observations suggests that terrestrial planet systems may also be formed in `planet traps&#39;
We show that the exoplanet HAT-P-7b has an extremely tilted orbit with a true angle of at least 86 degrees with respect to its parent star&#39;s equatorial plane and a strong possibility of retrograde motion We also report evidence for an additional planet or companion star The evidence for the unparalleled orbit and the third body is based on precise observations of the star&#39;s apparent radial velocity
The anomalous radial velocity due to rotation (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) was found to be a blueshift during the first half of the transit and a redshift during the second half an inversion of the usual pattern implying that the angle between the sky-projected orbital and stellar angular momentum vectors is 182
We analyze the extreme high-magnification microlensing event OGLE-2008-BLG-279 which peaked at a maximum magnification of A ~ 1600 on 30 May 2008 The peak of this event exhibits both finite-source effects and terrestrial parallax from which we determine the mass of the lens M_l=0 64 +/- 0 10 M_Sun and its distance
D_l = 4 0 +/- 0 6 We rule out Jupiter-mass planetary companions to the lens star for projected separations in the range 0 5-20 AU More generally we find that this event was sensitive to planets with masses as small as 0 2 M_Earth ~= 2 M_Mars with projected separations near the Einstein ring (~3 AU)
When protoplanets growing by accretion of planetesimals have atmospheres small planetesimals approaching the protoplanets lose their energy by gas drag from the atmospheres which leads them to be captured within the Hill sphere of the protoplanets As a result growth rates of the protoplanets are enhanced In order to study the effect of an atmosphere on planetary growth rates
we performed numerical integration of orbits of planetesimals for a wide range of orbital elements and obtained the effective accretion rates of planetesimals onto planets that have atmospheres Numerical results are obtained as a function of planetesimals&#39; eccentricity inclination planet&#39;s radius and non-dimensional gas-drag parameters which can be expressed by several physical quantities such as the radius of planetesimals and the mass of the protoplanet
Assuming that the radial distribution of the gas density near the surface can be approximated by a power-law we performed analytic calculation for the loss of planetesimals&#39; kinetic energy due to gas drag and confirmed agreement with numerical results We confirmed that the above approximation of the power-law density distribution is reasonable for accretion rate of protoplanets with one to ten Earth-masses
unless the size of planetesimals is too small We also calculated the accretion rates of planetesimals averaged over a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities and inclinations and derived a semi-analytical formula of accretion rates which reproduces the numerical results very well Using the obtained expression of the accretion rate we examined the growth of protoplanets in nebular gas
The material that formed the present-day Solar System originated in feeding zones in the inner Solar Nebula located at distances within ~20 AU from the Sun known as the planet-forming zone Meteoritic and cometary material contain abundant evidence for the presence of a rich and active chemistry in the planet-forming zone during the gas-rich phase of Solar System formation
It is a natural conjecture that analogs can be found amoung the zoo of protoplanetary disks around nearby young stars The study of the chemistry and dynamics of planet formation requires 1) tracers of dense gas at 100-1000 K and 2) imaging capabilities of such tracers with 5-100 (0 5-20 AU) milli-arcsec resolution
corresponding to the planet-forming zone at the distance of the closest star-forming regions Recognizing that the rich infrared (2-200 micron) molecular spectrum recently discovered to be common in protoplanetary disks represents such a tracer we present a new general raytracing code RADLite that is optimized for producing infrared line spectra and images from axisymmetric structures
RADLite can consistently deal with a wide range of velocity gradients such as those typical for the inner regions of protoplanetary disks The code is intended as a backend for chemical and excitation codes and can rapidly produce spectra of thousands of lines for grids of models for comparison with observations
The lifetime of isolated protoplanetary disks is thought to be set by the combination of viscous accretion and photoevaporation driven by stellar high-energy photons Observational evidence for magnetospheric accretion in young sun-like stars is robust Here we report the first observational evidence for disk photoevaporation driven by the central star
We acquired high-resolution (R~30 000) spectra of the [NeII] 12 81 micron line from 7 circumstellar disks using VISIR on Melipal/VLT We show that the 3 transition disks in the sample all have [NeII] line profiles consistent with those predicted by a photoevaporative flow driven by stellar extreme UV photons
The ~6 km/s blue-shift of the line from the almost face-on disk of TW Hya is clearly inconsistent with emission from a static disk atmosphere and convincingly points to the presence of a photoevaporative wind We do not detect any [NeII] line close to the stellar velocity from the sample of classical optically thick (non-transition) disks
The mysterious solar system object 133P/(7968) Elst-Pizarro is dynamically asteroidal yet displays recurrent comet-like dust emission Two scenarios were hypothesized to explain this unusual behavior (1) 133P is a classical comet from the outer solar system that has evolved onto a main-belt orbit or (2) 133P is a dynamically ordinary main-belt asteroid on which subsurface ice has recently been exposed
If (1) is correct the expected rarity of a dynamical transition onto an asteroidal orbit implies that 133P could be alone in the main belt In contrast if (2) is correct other icy main-belt objects should exist and could also exhibit cometary activity Believing 133P to be a dynamically ordinary
yet icy main-belt asteroid I set out to test the primary prediction of the hypothesis that 133P-like objects should be common and could be found by an appropriately designed observational survey I conducted just such a survey -- the Hawaii Trails Project -- of selected main-belt asteroids in a search for objects displaying cometary activity
I made 657 observations of 599 asteroids discovering one active object now known as 176P/LINEAR leading to the identification of the new cometary class of main-belt comets These results suggest that there could be ~100 currently active main-belt comets among low-inclination kilometer-scale outer belt asteroids Physically and statistically main-belt comet activity is consistent with initiation by meter-sized impactors
We present three-dimensional numerical simulations of particle clumping and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks with varying amounts of solid material As centimeter-size pebbles settle to the mid-plane turbulence develops through vertical shearing and streaming instabilities We find that when the pebble-to-gas column density ratio is 0 01 corresponding roughly to solar metallicity
clumping is weak so the pebble density rarely exceeds the gas density Doubling the column density ratio leads to a dramatic increase in clumping with characteristic particle densities more than ten times the gas density and maximum densities reaching several thousand times the gas density This is consistent with unstratified simulations of the streaming instability that show strong clumping in particle dominated flows
The clumps readily contract gravitationally into interacting planetesimals of order 100 km in radius Our results suggest that the correlation between host star metallicity and exoplanets may reflect the early stages of planet formation We further speculate that initially low metallicity disks can be particle enriched during the gas dispersal phase
Recent direct imaging discoveries suggest a new class of massive distant planets around A stars These widely separated giants have been interpreted as signs of planet formation driven by gravitational instability but the viability of this mechanism is not clear cut In this paper we first discuss the local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales
We then consider whether the fragment&#39;s subsequent growth can be terminated within the planetary mass regime Finally we place disks in the larger context of star formation and disk evolution models We find that in order for gravitational instability to produce planets disks must be atypically cold in order to reduce the initial fragment mass
In addition fragmentation must occur during a narrow window of disk evolution after infall has mostly ceased but while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational instability Under more typical conditions disk-born objects will likely grow well above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit We conclude that if planets are formed by gravitational instability
they must be the low mass tail of the distribution of disk-born companions To validate this theory on-going direct imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star companions to A-stars Their absence would suggest planet formation by a different mechanism such as core accretion which is consistent with the debris disks detected in these systems
We present time series photometry of the M dwarf transiting exoplanet system GJ 436 obtained with the the EPOCh (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization) component of the NASA EPOXI mission We conduct a search of the high-precision time series for additional planets around GJ 436 which could be revealed either directly through their photometric transits
or indirectly through the variations these second planets induce on the transits of the previously known planet In the case of GJ 436 the presence of a second planet is perhaps indicated by the residual orbital eccentricity of the known hot Neptune companion We find no candidate transits with significance higher than our detection limit
From Monte Carlo tests of the time series we rule out transiting planets larger than 1 5 R_Earth interior to GJ 436b with 95% confidence and larger than 1 25 R_Earth with 80% confidence Assuming coplanarity of additional planets with the orbit of GJ 436b we cannot expect that putative planets with orbital periods longer than about 3
However if such a planet were to transit we rule out planets larger than 2 0 R_Earth with orbital periods less than 8 5 days with 95% confidence We also place dynamical constraints on additional bodies in the GJ 436 system Our analysis should serve as a useful guide for similar analyses for which radial velocity measurements are not available
such as those discovered by the Kepler mission These dynamical constraints on additional planets with periods from 0 5 to 9 days rule out coplanar secular perturbers as small as 10 M_Earth and non-coplanar secular perturbers as small as 1 M_Earth in orbits close in to GJ 436b We present refined estimates of the system parameters for GJ 436
The aim of this work is a detailed analysis of transit light curves from TrES-1 and TrES-2 obtained over a period of three to four years in order to search for variabilities in observed mid-transit times and to set limits for the presence of additional third bodies Using the IAC 80cm telescope
we observed transits of TrES-1 and TrES-2 over several years Based on these new data and previously published work we studied the observed light curves and searched for variations in the difference between observed and calculated (based on a fixed ephemeris) transit times To model possible transit timing variations we used polynomials of different orders
simulated O-C diagrams corresponding to a perturbing third mass and sinusoidal fits For each model we calculated the chi-squared residuals and the False Alarm Probability (FAP) For TrES-1 we can exclude planetary companions (&gt;1 M_earth) in the 3 2 and 2 1 MMRs having high FAPs based on our transit observations from ground
Additionally the presence of a light time effect caused by e g a 0 09 M_sun mass star at a distance of 7 8 AU is possible As for TrES-2 we found a better ephemeris of Tc = 2 453 957 63512(28) + 2 4706101(18) x Epoch and a good fit for a sine function with a period of 0
compatible with a moon around TrES-2 and an amplitude of 57 s but it was not a uniquely low chi-squared value that would indicate a clear signal In both cases TrES-1 and TrES-2 we were able to put upper limits on the presence of additional perturbers masses We also conclude that any sinusoidal variations that might be indicative of exomoons need to be confirmed with higher statistical significance by further observations
The origin of Titan&#39;s atmospheric methane is a key issue for understanding the origin of the Saturnian satellite system It has been proposed that serpentinization reactions in Titan&#39;s interior could lead to the formation of the observed methane Meanwhile alternative scenarios suggest that methane was incorporated in Titan&#39;s planetesimals before its formation
Here we point out that serpentinization reactions in Titan&#39;s interior are not able to reproduce the deuterium over hydrogen (D/H) ratio observed at present in methane in its atmosphere and would require a maximum D/H ratio in Titan&#39;s water ice 30% lower than the value likely acquired by the satellite during its formation
based on Cassini observations at Enceladus Alternatively production of methane in Titan&#39;s interior via radiolytic reactions with water can be envisaged but the associated production rates remain uncertain On the other hand a mechanism that easily explains the presence of large amounts of methane trapped in Titan in a way consistent with its measured atmospheric D/H ratio is its direct capture in the satellite&#39;s planetesimals at the time of their formation in the solar nebula
Tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planet perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to a so-called tidal fixed point in which the apsidal lines of the transiting planet and its perturber are aligned and for which variations in the orbital eccentricities of both planet and perturber are damped out
Significant contributions to the apsidal precession rate are made by the secular planet-planet interaction by general relativity and by the gravitational quadropole fields created by the transiting planet&#39;s tidal and rotational distortions The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is therefore a strong function of the planet&#39;s interior structure
We illustrate these ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13 exo-planetary system and show that one can already glean important insights into the physical properties of the inner transiting planet We present structural models of the planet which indicate that its observed radius can be maintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass and tidal energy dissipation in the interior
We use an octopole-order secular theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet&#39;s eccentricity on its tidal Love number We find that the currently measured eccentricity implies 0 116 &lt; k2_{b} &lt; 0 425 0 M_{Earth}&lt;M_{core}&lt;120 M_{Earth}$ and Q_{b} &lt; 300 000 Improved measurement of the eccentricity will soon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all three of these quantities
Duschl et al (2000) have shown that the standard model for geometrically thin accretion disks ($\alpha$-disks) leads to inconsistency if self-gravity play a role This problem arise from parametrization of viscosity in terms of local sound velocity and vertical disks scale hight The $\beta$-viscosity prescription was introduced by Duschl et al
(2000) which has been derived from rotating shear flow experiment ($\nu=\beta \Omega R^2$) Following the Duschl et al (2000) suggestion for a $\beta$-prescription for viscosity we apply this model for a thin self-gravitating disk around newborn stars Our result is quite different with standard alpha disks in the outer part of the disks where the self-gravity becomes important
In the inner part of the disks our solution converged to the standard $\alpha$ disks It has been presented that for beta model Toomre parameter is more than unity everywhere which means that gravitational fragmentation can be occur everywhere We suggest that the kind of hydrodynamically driven viscosity $\beta$-model can be used for modeling of accretion disks from proto-stellar disks to AGN and galactic disks
We investigate the dynamical evolution of the terrestrial planets during the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets A basic assumption of this work is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of terrestrial planet formation such as in the models that link the former to the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment
The divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with k ranging from 1 to 4 Consequently these secular resonances cause large-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets We show that the resonances g5=g_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if Jupiter and Saturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2
On the other hand the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are more of a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with the current one We offer two solutions to this problem The first uses the fact that a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a Fourier mode if the latter is large originally
A second scenario involves a &#39;jumping Jupiter&#39; in which encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter without ejection of the former cause the latter to migrate away from Saturn much faster than if migration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals In this case the g5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over
We study the dynamics of a vertically thin dispersion-dominated disk of planetesimals with eccentricities $e$ and inclinations $i$ (normalized in Hill units) satisfying $e &gt;&gt; 1$ $i &lt;&lt; e^{-2} &lt;&lt; 1$ This situation may be typical for e g a population of protoplanetary cores in the end of the oligarchic phase of planet formation
In this regime of orbital parameters planetesimal scattering has an anisotropic character and strongly differs from scattering in thick ($i ~ e$) disks We derive analytical expressions for the planetesimal scattering coefficients and compare them with numerical calculations We find significant discrepancies in the inclination scattering coefficients obtained by the two approaches and ascribe this difference to the effects not accounted for in the analytical calculation
multiple scattering events (temporary captures which may be relevant for the production of distant planetary satellites outside the Hill sphere) and distant interaction of planetesimals prior to their close encounter Our calculations show that the inclination of a thin dispersion-dominated planetesimal disk grows exponentially on a very short time scale implying that (1) such disks must be very short-lived and (2) planetesimal accretion in this dynamical phase is insignificant
We investigate the astrometric performance of the FORS1 and FORS2 cameras of the VLT at long time scales with emphasis on systematic errors which normally prevent attainning a precision better than 1mas The study is based on multi- epoch time series of observations of a single sky region imaged with a time spacing of 2-6 years at FORS1 and 1-5 months at FORS2
We performed a detailed analysis of a random error of positions that was shown to be dominated by the uncertainty of the star photocenter determination The component of the random error corresponding to image motion was found to be caused primarily by optical aberrations and variations of atmospheric PSF size but not by the effect of atmospheric image motion
Comparison of observed and model annual/monthly epoch average positions yielded estimates of systematic errors for which temporal properties and distribution in the CCD plane are given At frame center the systematic component is about 25 mu-as Systematic errors are shown to be caused mainly by a combined effect of the image asymmetry and seeing variations which therefore should be strongly limited to avoid generating random and systematic errors
For a series of 30 images we demonstrated presicion of about 50 mu-as stable on daily monthly and annual time scales Relative proper motion and trigonometric parallaxes of stars in the center of the test field were derived with a precision of 20 mu-as/yr and 40 mu-as for 17-19 mag stars
We report the discovery of the transiting giant planet WASP-17b the least-dense planet currently known It is 1 6 Saturn masses but 1 5-2 Jupiter radii giving a density of 6-14 per cent that of Jupiter WASP-17b is in a 3 7-day orbit around a sub-solar metallicity V = 11
F6 star Preliminary detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect suggests that WASP-17b is in a retrograde orbit (lambda ~ -150 deg) indicative of a violent history involving planet-planet or star-planet scattering <br>WASP-17b&#39;s bloated radius could be due to tidal heating resulting from recent or ongoing tidal circularisation of an eccentric orbit
such as the highly eccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions It will thus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricity by further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing the secondary eclipse both to reduce the uncertainty on the planet&#39;s radius and to test tidal-heating models
The Quadrantid shower one of the most intense showers has been observed at the beginning of January each year However the origin of the meteors is still unknown It was Hasegawa (1979) who first suggested comet C/1490 Y1 to be the likely origin of the shower based on the historical records of East Asia
We analyse the records of Jo-Seon-Wang-Jo-Sil-Lok (the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty in ancient Korea) and calculate the preliminary orbital elements of comet C/1490 Y1 using a modified Gauss method We find that comet C/1490 Y1 was a periodic one and its orbital path was very similar to that of the Quadrantid meteor stream
The determined orbital elements are perifocal passage time Tp=2265652 2983 days (7 8 Jan 1491 in UT) perifocal distance q=0 769 AU eccentricity e=0 747 semimajor axis a=3 04 AU argument of the perifocus omega=164 03 degrees longitude of ascending node Omega=283 00 degrees and inclination i=70 22 degrees for the epoch of J2000
Currently over forty transiting planets have been discovered by ground-based photometric surveys and space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT are expected to detect hundreds more Follow-up photometric observations from the ground will play an important role in constraining both orbital and physical parameters for newly discovered planets especially those with small radii (R_p less than approximately 4 Earth radii) and/or intermediate to long orbital periods (P greater than approximately 30 days)
Here we simulate transit light curves from Kepler-like photometry and ground-based observations in the near-infrared (NIR) to determine how jointly modeling space-based and ground-based light curves can improve measurements of the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio We find that adding observations of at least one ground-based transit to space-based observations can significantly improve the accuracy for measuring the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio of small planets (R_p less than approximately 4 Earth radii) in long-period (~1 year) orbits
largely thanks to the reduced effect of limb darkening in the NIR We also demonstrate that multiple ground-based observations are needed to gain a substantial improvement in the measurement accuracy for small planets with short orbital periods (~3 days) Finally we consider the role that higher ground-based precisions will play in constraining parameter measurements for typical Kepler targets
We study the role of dust-dust collisional charging in protoplanetary discs We show that dust-dust collisional charging becomes an important process in determining the charge state of dust and gas if there is dust enhancement and/or dust is fluffy so that dust surface area per disc volume is locally increased
<br>We solve the charge equilibrium equations for various disc environments and dust number density $\eta$ using general purpose graphic processors (GPGPU) and {\sc cuda} programming language We found that as dust number density $\eta$ increases the charge distribution experience four phases In one of these phases the electrostatic field $E$ caused by dust motion increases as $E \propto \eta^4$
As a result macroscopic electric discharge takes place for example at $\eta = 70$ (in units of minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) values considering two groups of fluffy dust with radii $10^{-2}\unit{cm}$ $10^{2}\unit{cm}$) We present a model that describes the charge exchange processes in the discs as an electric circuit We derive analytical formulae of critical dust number density for lightning
as functions of dust parameters <br>We estimate the total energy intensity and event ratio of such discharges (`lightning&#39;) We discuss the possibility of observing lightning and sprite discharges in protoplanetary discs by Astronomically Low Frequency ({\em ALF}) waves {\em IR} images {\em UV} lines and high energy gamma rays We also discuss the effects of lightning on chondrule heating
We report the detection of sub-Saturn-mass planet MOA-2008-BLG-310Lb and argue that it is the strongest candidate yet for a bulge planet Deviations from the single-lens fit are smoothed out by finite-source effects and so are not immediately apparent from the light curve Nevertheless we find that a model in which the primary has a planetary companion is favored over the single-lens model by \Delta\chi^2 ~ 880 for an additional three degrees of freedom
Detailed analysis yields a planet/star mass ratio q=(3 3+/-0 3)x10^{-4} and an angular separation between the planet and star within 10% of the angular Einstein radius The small angular Einstein radius \theta_E=0 155+/-0 011 mas constrains the distance to the lens to be D_L&gt;6 0 kpc if it is a star (M_L&gt;0
This is the only microlensing exoplanet host discovered so far that must be in the bulge if it is a star By analyzing VLT NACO adaptive optics images taken near the baseline of the event we detect additional blended light that is aligned to within 130 mas of the lensed source
This light is plausibly from the lens but could also be due to a companion to lens or source or possibly an unassociated star If the blended light is indeed due to the lens we can estimate the mass of the lens M_L=0 67+/-0 14 M_sun planet mass m=74+/-17 M_Earth
and projected separation between the planet and host 1 25+/-0 10 AU putting it right on the &#34;snow line&#34; If not then the planet has lower mass is closer to its host and is colder To distinguish among these possibilities on reasonable timescales would require obtaining Hubble Space Telescope images almost immediately
Transiting extrasolar planets provide an opportunity to study the mass-radius relation of planets as well as their internal structure The existence of a secondary eclipse enables further study of the thermal properties of the the planet by observing at infrared wavelengths The probability of an observable secondary eclipse depends upon the orbital parameters of the planet
particularly eccentricity and argument of periastron Here we provide analytical expressions for these probabilities investigate their properties and calculate their values for the known extrasolar planets We furthermore quantitatively discuss constraints on existence and observability of primary transits if a secondary eclipse is observed Finally we calculate the a-posteriori transit probabilities of the known extrasolar planets
We model the assembly of planets from planetary embryos under the conditions suggested by various scenarios for the formation of the planetary system around the millisecond pulsar B1257+12 We find that the most likely models fall at the low angular momentum end of the proposed range Models that invoke supernova fallback produce such disks
although we find that a solar composition disk produces a more likely evolution than one composed primarily of heavy elements Furthermore we find that dust sedimentation must occur rapidly as the disk cools in order that the solid material be confined to a sufficiently narrow range of radii A quantitative comparison between the observations and the best-fit models shows that the simulations can reproduce the observed eccentricities and masses
We study the evolution of circumstellar massive disks around the primary star of a binary system focusing on the computation of disk eccentricity In particular we concentrate on its dependence on the binary eccentricity Self-gravity is included in our numerical simulations Our standard model assumes a semimajor axis for the binary of 30 AU
The Galileo spacecraft was orbiting Jupiter between Dec 1995 and Sep 2003 The Galileo dust detector monitored the jovian dust environment between about 2 and 370 R_J (jovian radius R_J = 71492 km) We present data from the Galileo dust instrument for the period January 2000 to September 2003 We report on the data of 5389 particles measured between 2000 and the end of the mission in 2003
The majority of the 21250 particles for which the full set of measured impact parameters (impact time impact direction charge rise times charge amplitudes etc ) was transmitted to Earth were tiny grains (about 10 nm in radius) most of them originating from Jupiter&#39;s innermost Galilean moon Io Their impact rates frequently exceeded 10 min^-1
Surprisingly large impact rates up to 100 min^-1 occurred in Aug/Sep 2000 when Galileo was at about 280 R_J from Jupiter This peak in dust emission appears to coincide with strong changes in the release of neutral gas from the Io torus Strong variability in the Io dust flux was measured on timescales of days to weeks
indicating large variations in the dust release from Io or the Io torus or both on such short timescales Galileo has detected a large number of bigger micron-sized particles mostly in the region between the Galilean moons A surprisingly large number of such bigger grains was measured in March 2003 within a 4-day interval when Galileo was outside Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere at approximately 350 R_J jovicentric distance
We present the first evidence of a retrograde orbit of the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b The discovery is based on a measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with the Subaru HDS during a transit of HAT-P-7b which occurred on UT 2008 May 30 Our best-fit model shows that the spin-orbit alignment angle of this planet is \lambda = -132
Is life a common outcome of physical and chemical processes in the universe? Within our own solar system a successful search for even primitive life were it to have an origin independent from life on Earth would dramatically advance a positive answer The most stringent test for a second independent origin of life on Earth would come from examination of either the most physically remote from Earth
or the most exotic type of planetary environments in which one might plausibly imagine a form of life could exist In this paper I argue that Saturn&#39;s moon Titan is the best such target in our solar system Further Titan might be a type example of a planetary environment abundant throughout the cosmos
We explore planet formation in binary systems around the central star where the protoplanetary disk plane is highly inclined with respect to the companion star orbit This might be the most frequent scenario for binary separations larger than 40 AU according to Hale (1994) We focus on planetesimal accretion and compute average impact velocities in the habitable region and up to 6 AU from the primary
We present radial velocity (RV) measurements of our sample of 40 M dwarfs from our planet search programme with VLT+UVES begun in 2000 Although with our RV precision down to 2 - 2 5 m/s and timebase line of up to 7 years we are capable of finding planets of a few Earth masses in the close-in habitable zones of M dwarfs
there is no detection of a planetary companion To demonstrate this we present mass detection limits allowing us to exclude Jupiter-mass planets up to 1 AU for most of our sample stars We identified 6 M dwarfs that host a brown dwarf or low-mass stellar companion With the exception of these
all other sample stars show low RV variability with an rms &lt; 20 m/s Some high proper motion stars exhibit a linear RV trend consistent with their secular acceleration Furthermore we examine our data sets for a possible correlation between RVs and stellar activity as seen in variations of the Halpha line strength
Near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) is the primary target of the Hayabusa-2 sample return mission and a potential target of the Marco Polo sample return mission Earth-based studies of this object are fundamental to these missions We present a mid-infrared spectrum (5-38 microns) of 1999 JU3 obtained with NASA&#39;s Spitzer Space Telescope in May 2008
These observations place new constraints on the surface properties of this asteroid To fit our spectrum we used the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) and the more complex thermophysical model (TPM) However the position of the spin-pole which is uncertain is a crucial input parameter for constraining the thermal inertia with the TPM; hence
we consider two pole orientations In the extreme case of an equatorial retrograde geometry we derive a lower limit to the thermal inertia of 150 J/m^2/K/s^0 5 If we adopt the pole orientation of Abe et al (2008a) our best-fit thermal model yields a value for the thermal inertia of 700+/-200 J/m^2/K/s^0
The lower limit to the thermal inertia which is unlikely but possible would be consistent with a fine regolith similar to wthat is found for asteroid 433 Eros However the thermal inertia is expected to be higher possibly similar to or greater than that on asteroid 25143 Itokawa Accurately determining the spin-pole of asteroid 162173 will narrow the range of possible values for its thermal inertia
The migration of growing protoplanets depends on the thermodynamics of the ambient disc Standard modelling using locally isothermal discs indicate in the low planet mass regime an inward (type-I) migration Taking into account non-isothermal effects recent studies have shown that the direction of the type-I migration can change from inward to outward
In this paper we extend previous two-dimensional studies and investigate the planet-disc interaction in viscous radiative discs using fully three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary accretion discs with embedded planets for a range of planetary masses <br>We use an explicit three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity
We have added implicit radiation transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation and to speed up the simulations significantly we have newly adapted and implemented the FARGO-algorithm in a 3D context <br>First we present results of test simulations that demonstrate the accuracy of the newly implemented FARGO-method in 3D For a planet mass of 20 M_earth we then show that the inclusion of radiative effects yields a torque reversal also in full 3D
For the same opacity law used the effect is even stronger in 3D than in the corresponding 2D simulations due to a slightly thinner disc Finally we demonstrate the extent of the torque reversal by calculating a sequence of planet masses Through full 3D simulations of embedded planets in viscous
Hill&#39;s equations are an approximation that is useful in a number of areas of astrophysics including planetary rings and planetesimal disks We derive a symplectic method for integrating Hill&#39;s equations based on a generalized leapfrog This method is implemented in the parallel N-body code PKDGRAV and tested on some simple orbits
The Ulysses spacecraft has been orbiting the Sun on a highly inclined ellipse since it encountered Jupiter in February 1992 Since then it made almost three revolutions about the Sun Here we report on the final three years of data taken by the on-board dust detector During this time the dust detector recorded 609 dust impacts of particles with masses 10^-16 g &lt;= m &lt;= 10^-7 g
bringing the mission total to 6719 dust data sets The impact rate varied from a low value of 0 3 per day at high ecliptic latitudes to 1 5 per day in the inner solar system The impact direction of the majority of impacts between 2005 and 2007 is compatible with particles of interstellar origin
the rest are most likely interplanetary particles We compare the interstellar dust measurements from 2005/2006 with the data obtained during earlier periods (1993/1994) and (1999/2000) when Ulysses was traversing the same spatial region at southern ecliptic latitudes but the solar cycle was at a different phase During these three intervals the impact rate of interstellar grains varied by more than a factor of two
Furthermore in the two earlier periods the grain impact direction was in agreement with the flow direction of the interstellar helium while in 2005/2006 we observed a shift in the approach direction of the grains by approximately 30 deg away from the ecliptic plane The reason for this shift remains unclear but may be connected with the configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field during solar maximum
We present evidence that the WASP-14 exoplanetary system has misaligned orbital and stellar-rotational axes with an angle lambda = 33 1 +/- 7 4 deg between their sky projections The evidence is based on spectroscopic observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect as well as new photometric observations WASP-14 is now the third system known to have a significant spin-orbit misalignment
The outburst and subsequent brightness evolution of Comet 17P/Holmes has been observed using the MMT Observatory&#39;s All-Sky Camera (Pickering 2006) on Mt Hopkins near Tucson Arizona USA The comet was picked up at the limiting visual magnitude of 5 5 on October 24 38 and tracked by the camera continuously until sunrise four hours later
During this time the comet brightened to visual magnitude 3 5 Comet Holmes was next observed just after sunset on October 25 23 at visual magnitude 2 5 where it remained approximately constant over the next three days The comet then began to dim slowly and was followed into the early months of 2008 with periods of dense time coverage
Magnetic fields are dragged in from the interstellar medium during the gravitational collapse that forms star/disk systems Consideration of mean field magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in these disks shows that magnetic effects produce subkeplerian rotation curves and truncate the inner disk This letter explores the ramifications of these predicted disk properties for the migration of extrasolar planets
Subkeplerian flow in gaseous disks drives a new migration mechanism for embedded planets and modifies the gap opening processes for larger planets This subkeplerian migration mechanism dominates over Type I migration for sufficiently small planets (m_P &lt; 1 M_\earth) and/or close orbits (r &lt; 1 AU) Although the inclusion of subkeplerian torques shortens the total migration time by only a moderate amount
the mass accreted by migrating planetary cores is significantly reduced Truncation of the inner disk edge (for typical system parameters) naturally explains final planetary orbits with periods P=4 days Planets with shorter periods P=2 days can be explained by migration during FU-Ori outbursts when the mass accretion rate is high and the disk edge moves inward
We report a stellar flare occurring during a transit of the exoplanet OGLE-TR-10b an event not previously reported in the literature This reduces the observed transit depth particularly in the u&#39;-band but flaring could also be significant in other bands and could lead to incorrect planetary parameters We suggest that OGLE-TR-10a is an active planet-hosting star and has an unusually high X-ray luminosity
A survey of currently known planet-hosting stars indicates that approximately 25% of extrasolar planetary systems are within dual-star environments Several of these systems contain stellar companions on moderately close orbits implying that studies of the formation and dynamical evolution of giant and terrestrial planets in and around binary star systems have now found realistic grounds
With the recent launch of the space telescope CoRoT and the launch of NASA&#39;s Kepler satellite in 2009 the number of such dynamically complex systems will soon increase and many more of their diverse and interesting dynamical characteristics will soon be discovered It is therefore both timely and necessary to obtain a deep understanding of the history and current status of research on planets in binary star systems
This chapter will serve this purpose by reviewing the models of the formation of giant and terrestrial planets in dual-star environments and by presenting results of the studies of their dynamical evolution and habitability as well as the mechanisms of delivery of water and other volatiles to their terrestrial-class objects
The gravitational instability of a dust layer is one of the scenarios for planetesimal formation If the density of a dust layer becomes sufficiently high as a result of the sedimentation of dust grains toward the midplane of a protoplanetary disk the layer becomes gravitationally unstable and spontaneously fragments into planetesimals
Using a shearing box method we performed local $N$-body simulations of gravitational instability of a dust layer and subsequent coagulation without gas and investigated the basic formation process of planetesimals In this paper we adopted the accretion model as a collision model A gravitationally bound pair of particles is replaced by a single particle with the total mass of the pair
This accretion model enables us to perform long-term and large-scale calculations We confirmed that the formation process of planetesimals is the same as that in the previous paper with the rubble pile models The formation process is divided into three stages the formation of non-axisymmetric structures the creation of planetesimal seeds
and their collisional growth We investigated the dependence of the planetesimal mass on the simulation domain size We found that the mean mass of planetesimals formed in simulations is proportional to $L_y^{3/2}$ where $L_y$ is the size of the computational domain in the direction of rotation However the mean mass of planetesimals is independent of $L_x$
We explore conventional Neptune migration model with one additional planet of mass at 0 1-2 0 Me This planet inhabited in the 3 2 mean motion resonance with Neptune during planet migration epoch and then escaped from the Kuiper belt when Jovian planets parked near the present orbits Adding this extra planet and assuming the primordial disk truncated at about 45 AU in the conventional Neptune migration model
it is able to explain the complex structure of the observed Kuiper belt better than the usual Neptune migration model did in several respects However numerical experiments imply that this model is a low-probability event In addition to the low probability two features produced by this model may be inconsistent with the observations
They are small number of low-inclination particles in the classical belt and the production of a remnant population with near-circular and low-inclination orbit within a = 50-52 AU According to our present study including one extra planet in the conventional Neptune migration model as the scenario we explored here may be unsuitable because of the low probability
and the two drawbacks mentioned above although this model can explain better several features which is hard to produce by the conventional Neptune migration model The issues of low-probability event and the lack of low-inclination KBOs in the classical belt are interesting and may be studied further under a more realistic consideration
We present two exoplanets detected at Keck Observatory HD 179079 is a G5 subgiant that hosts a hot Neptune planet with Msini = 27 5 M_earth in a 14 48 d low-eccentricity orbit The stellar reflex velocity induced by this planet has a semiamplitude of K = 6 6 m/s
HD 73534 is a G5 subgiant with a Jupiter-like planet of Msini = 1 1 M_jup and K = 16 m/s in a nearly circular 4 85 yr orbit Both stars are chromospherically inactive and metal-rich We discuss a known classical bias in measuring eccentricities for orbits with velocity semiamplitudes
We measure the angle between the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation axis in the transiting planetary system CoRoT-1 with new HIRES/Keck and FORS/VLT high-accuracy photometry The data indicate a highly tilted system with a projected spin-orbit angle lambda = 77 +- 11 degrees Systematic uncertainties in the radial velocity data could cause the actual errors to be larger by an unknown amount
and this result needs to be confirmed with further high-accuracy spectroscopic transit measurements <br>Spin-orbit alignment has now been measured in a dozen extra-solar planetary systems and several show strong misalignment The first three misaligned planets were all much more massive than Jupiter and followed eccentric orbits CoRoT-1 however is a jovian-mass close-in planet on a circular orbit
We present refined parameters for the extrasolar planetary system HAT-P-2 (also known as HD 147506) based on new radial velocity and photometric data HAT-P-2b is a transiting extrasolar planet that exhibits an eccentric orbit We present a detailed analysis of the planetary and stellar parameters yielding consistent results for the mass and radius of the star
better constraints on the orbital eccentricity and refined planetary parameters The improved parameters for the host star are M_star = 1 36 +/- 0 04 M_sun and R_star = 1 64 +/- 0 08 R_sun while the planet has a mass of M_p = 9 09 +/- 0 24 M_Jup and radius of R_p = 1
The refined transit epoch and period for the planet are E = 2 454 387 49375 +/- 0 00074 (BJD) and P = 5 6334729 +/- 0 0000061 (days) and the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are e = 0 5171 +/- 0 0033 and omega = 185 22 +/- 0
These orbital elements allow us to predict the timings of secondary eclipses with a reasonable accuracy of ~15 minutes We also discuss the effects of this significant eccentricity including the characterization of the asymmetry in the transit light curve Simple formulae are presented for the above and these in turn
While Saturn&#39;s moon Titan appears to support an active methane hydrological cycle no direct evidence for surface-atmosphere exchange has yet appeared It is possible that the identified lake-features could be filled with ethane an involatile long term residue of atmospheric photolysis; the apparent stream and channel features could be ancient from a previous climate; and the tropospheric methane clouds
while frequent could cause no rain to reach the surface We report here the detection of fog at the south pole of Titan during late summer using observations from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft While terrestrial fog can form from a variety of causes most of these processes are inoperable on Titan
Fog on Titan can only be caused by evaporation of liquid methane; the detection of fog provides the first direct link between surface and atmospheric methane Based on the detections presented here liquid methane appears widespread at the south pole of Titan in late southern summer and the hydrolgical cycle on Titan is current active
Here we show that Iapetus can serve to discriminate between satellite formation models Its accretion history can be understood in terms of a two-component gaseous subnebula with a relatively dense inner region and an extended tail out to the location of the irregular satellites as in the SEMM model of Mosqueira and Estrada (2003a
b) Following giant planet formation planetesimals in the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn become dynamically excited and undergo a collisional cascade Ablation and capture of planetesimal fragments crossing the gaseous circumplanetary disks delivers enough collisional rubble to account for the mass budgets of the regular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn
This process can result in rock/ice fractionation provided the make up of the population of disk crossers is non-homogeneous thus offering a natural explanation for the marked compositional differences between outer solar nebula objects and those that accreted in the subnebulae of the giant planets Consequently our model leads to an enhancement of the ice content of Iapetus
We continue our exploration of whether the flyby anomalies can be explained by scattering of spacecraft nucleons from dark matter gravitationally bound to the earth We formulate and analyze a simple model in which inelastic and elastic scatterers populate shells generated by the precession of circular orbits with normals tilted with respect to the earth&#39;s axis
In Gayon &amp; Bois (2008) and Gayon etal (2009) (i) we studied the theoretical feasibility and efficiency of retrograde mean motion resonances (i e two planets are both in orbital resonance and in counter-revolving configuration) (ii) we showed that retrograde resonances can generate interesting mechanisms of stability and (iii) we obtained a dynamical fit involving a counter-revolving configuration that is consistent with the observations of the HD73526 planetary system
In the present paper we present and analyze data reductions assuming counter-revolving configurations for eight compact multi-planetary systems detected through the radial velocity method In each case we select the best fit leading to a dynamically stable solution The resulting data reductions obtained in rms and chi values for counter-revolving configurations are of the same order
In this paper we present results of two novel experimental methods to investigate the collisional behavior of individual macroscopic icy bodies The experiments reported here were conducted in the microgravity environments of parabolic flights and the Bremen drop tower facility Using a cryogenic parabolic-flight setup we were able to capture 41 near-central collisions of 1
The analysis of the image sequences provides a uniform distribution of coefficients of restitution with a mean value of $\overline{\varepsilon} = 0 45$ and values ranging from $\varepsilon = 0 06$ to 0 84 Additionally we designed a prototype drop tower experiment for collisions within an ensemble of up to one hundred cm-sized projectiles and performed the first experiments with solid glass beads
We were able to statistically analyze the development of the kinetic energy of the entire system which can be well explained by assuming a granular `fluid&#39; following Haff&#39;s law with a constant coefficient of restitution of $\varepsilon = 0 64$ We could also show that the setup is suitable for studying collisions at velocities of $&lt; 5 \mathrm{mm s^{-1}}$ appropriate for collisions between particles in Saturn&#39;s dense main rings
The effect of solar wind on dust particle meteoroid is investigated Rotation of the particle is also considered Detail derivations of both equation of motion and Euler&#39;s dynamical equations are presented The most simple form of the action of the solar wind is considered and the derived equation of motion reduces to &#34;pseudo-Poynting-Robertson effect&#34; for non-rotating spherical particle
The final equation of motion contains also angular velocity term and it may cause change of orbital plane of the meteoroid Analysis of the Euler&#39;s dynamical equations shows that rotational axis of the meteoroid changes in time and equilibrium state for the orientation of the axis of rotation does not exist for spherical particle
(abridged) In the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around early-type main-sequence stars we present the results obtained on the early F-type star Theta Cygni Elodie and Sophie at OHP were used to obtain the spectra Our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitor the star&#39;s radial velocities over five years
We also use complementary high angular resolution and high-contrast images taken with PUEO at CFHT We show that Theta Cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable with a ~150-day period These variations are not due to the ~0 35-Msun stellar companion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 AU from the star
The absence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and the radial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star as well as other criteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due to stellar spots The observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variations also seems to rule out stellar pulsations
However we observe a peak in the bisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in the radial velocity periodogram which indicates a probable link between these radial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which are of stellar origin Long-period variations are not expected from this type of star to our knowledge
If a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to be confirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations this would have several consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars both in terms of observational strategy and data analysis An alternative explanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at least one planet of a few Jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 AU
The aim of this survey is to investigate the dependence of planet formation on the mass of the host star by searching for planetary companions around intermediate-mass giants An iodine absorption cell was used to obtain accurate RVs for this study Our measurements reveal that the RVs of 11 UMi show a periodic variation of 516
The RV curve of HD 32518 shows sinusoidal variations with a period of 157 54 days The HIPPARCOS photometry as well as our H\alpha core flux measurements reveal no variability with the RV period Thus Keplerian motion is the most likely explanation for the observed RV variations for both giant stars
An exoplanet with a minimum mass of 10 5 Jupiter masses orbits the K giant 11 UMi The K1 III giant HD 32518 hosts a planetary companion with a minimum mass of 3 0 Jupiter masses in a nearly circular orbit These are the 4th and 5th planets published from this TLS survey
We present mid-infrared (8-33 micron) observations of the binary L5-Trojan system (617) Patroclus-Menoetius before during and after two shadowing events using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope F or the first time we effectively observe changes in asteroid surface temperature in real time allowing the thermal inertia to be determined very directly
A new detailed binary thermophysical model is presented which accounts for the system&#39;s known mutual orbit arbitrary component shapes and thermal conduction in the presence of eclipses We obtain two local thermal-inertia values representative of the respective shadowed areas 21+/14 MKS and 6 4+/-1 6 MKS The average thermal inertia is estimated to be 20+/-15 MKS
potentially with significant surface heterogeneity This first thermal-inertia measurement for a Trojan asteroid indicates a surface covered in fine regolith The diameters of Patroclus and Menoetius are 106 +/- 11 and 98+/-10 km respectively in agreement with previous findings Taken together with the system&#39;s known total mass this implies a bulk mass density of 1
We monitor the star HD 149026 and its Saturn-mass planet at 8 0 micron over slightly more than half an orbit using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope We find an increase of 0 0227% +/- 0 0066% (3 4 sigma significance) in the combined planet-star flux during this interval
The minimum flux from the planet is 45% +/- 19% of the maximum planet flux corresponding to a difference in brightness temperature of 480 +/- 140 K between the two hemispheres We derive a new secondary eclipse depth of 0 0411% +/- 0 0076% in this band corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of 1440 +/- 150 K
Our new secondary eclipse depth is half that of a previous measurement (3 0 sigma difference) in this same bandpass by Harrington et al (2007) We re-fit the Harrington et al (2007) data and obtain a comparably good fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value
In contrast to earlier claims our new eclipse depth suggests that this planet&#39;s dayside emission spectrum is relatively cool with an 8 micron brightness temperature that is less than the maximum planet-wide equilibrium temperature We measure the interval between the transit and secondary eclipse and find that that the secondary eclipse occurs 20
Structures were calculated for Mercury Venus Earth the Moon and Mars using a core-mantle model and adjusting the core radius to reproduce the observed mass and diameter of each body Structures were calculated using Fe and basalt equations of state of different degrees of sophistication for the core and mantle
The choice of equation of state had a significant effect on the inferred structure For each structure the moment of inertia ratio was calculated and compared with observed values Linear Grueneisen equations of state fitted to limited portions of shock data reproduced the observed moments of inertia significantly better than did more detailed equations of state incorporating phase transitions
The present obliquity of Mercury is very low (less than 0 1 degree) which led previous studies to always adopt a nearly zero obliquity during the planet&#39;s past evolution However the initial orientation of Mercury&#39;s rotation axis is unknown and probably much different than today As a consequence we believe that the obliquity could have been significant when the rotation rate of the planet first encountered spin-orbit resonances
In order to compute the capture probabilities in resonance for any evolutionary scenario we present in full detail the dynamical equations governing the long term evolution of the spin including the obliquity contribution <br>The secular spin evolution of Mercury results from tidal interactions with the Sun but also from viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary
Here this effect is also regarded with particular attention Previous studies show that a liquid core enhances drastically the chances of capture in spin-orbit resonances We confirm these results for null obliquity but we find that the capture probability generally decreases as the obliquity increases We finally show that when core-mantle friction is combined with obliquity evolution
We consider the problem of fitting a parametric model to time-series data that are afflicted by correlated noise The noise is represented by a sum of two stationary Gaussian processes one that is uncorrelated in time and another that has a power spectral density varying as $1/f^\gamma$ We present an accurate and fast [O(N)] algorithm for parameter estimation based on computing the likelihood in a wavelet basis
The method is illustrated and tested using simulated time-series photometry of exoplanetary transits with particular attention to estimating the midtransit time We compare our method to two other methods that have been used in the literature the time-averaging method and the residual-permutation method For noise processes that obey our assumptions
The study of warm molecular gas in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks is of key importance for the study of planet formation and especially for the transport of H2O and organic molecules to the surfaces of rocky planets/satellites Recent Spitzer observations have shown that the mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks are covered in emission lines due to water and other molecules
Here we present a non-LTE 2D radiative transfer model of water lines in the 10-36 mum range that can be used to constrain the abundance structure of water vapor given an observed spectrum and show that an assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) does not accurately estimate the physical conditions of the water vapor emission zones
By applying the model to published Spitzer spectra we find that 1) most water lines are subthermally excited 2) the gas-to-dust ratio must be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the canonical interstellar medium ratio of 100-200 and 3) the gas temperature must be higher than the dust temperature
and 4) the water vapor abundance in the disk surface must be truncated beyond ~ 1 AU A low efficiency of water formation below ~ 300 K may naturally result in a lower water abundance beyond a certain radius However we find that chemistry may not be sufficient to produce an abundance drop of many orders of magnitude and speculate that the depletion may also be caused by vertical turbulent diffusion of water vapor from the superheated surface to regions below the snow line
We investigate fluid motions near the midplane of vertically stratified accretion disks with highly resistive midplanes In such disks the magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in thin layers surrounding a resistive stable dead zone The turbulent layers in turn drive motions in the dead zone We examine the properties of these motions using three-dimensional
stratified local shearing-box non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to the midplane no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations It appears that this is because of strong vertical oscillations in the dead zone By analyzing time series of azimuthally-averaged flow quantities
we identify an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones This mode is reduced in amplitude but not suppressed entirely by changing the equation of state from isothermal to ideal These waves are too low-frequency to affect sedimentation of dust to the midplane but may have significance for the gravitational stability of the resulting midplane dust layers
Using the adaptive optics facilities at the 200-in Hale and 10-m Keck II we observed in the near infrared a sample of 12 binary and multiple stars and one open cluster We used the near diffraction limited images of these systems to measure the relative separations and position angles between their components
In this paper we investigate and correct for the influence of the differential chromatic refraction and chip distortions on our relative astrometric measurements Over one night we achieve an astrometric precision typically well below 1 miliarcsecond and occasionally as small as 40 microarcseconds Such a precision is in principle sufficient to astrometrically detect planetary mass objects around the components of nearby binary and multiple stars
The sidereal anisotropy of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity observed with the Tibet Air Shower (AS) experiment still awaits theoretical interpretation The observed global feature of the anisotropy is well reproduced by a superposition of the bi-directional and uni-directional flows (BDF and UDF respectively) of GCRs If the orientation of the deduced BDF represents the orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field (LISMF)
as indicated by best-fitting a model to the data the UDF deviating from the BDF orientation implies a significant contribution from the streaming perpendicular to the LISMF This perpendicular streaming is probably due to the drift anisotropy because the contribution from the perpendicular diffusion is expected to be much smaller than the drift effect
The large amplitude deduced for the UDF indicates a large spatial gradient of the GCR density We suggest that such a density gradient can be expected at the heliosphere sitting close to the boundary of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) if the LIC is expanding The spatial distribution of GCR density in the LIC reaches a stationary state because of the balance between the inward cross-field diffusion and the adiabatic cooling due to the expansion
We derive the steady-state distribution of GCR density in the LIC based on radial transport of GCRs in a spherical LIC expanding at a constant rate By comparing the expected gradient with the observation by Tibet experiment we estimate the perpendicular diffusion coefficient of multi-TeV GCRs in the local interstellar space
There are now many known exoplanets with Msin(i) within a factor of two of Neptune&#39;s including the transiting planets GJ436b and HAT-P-11b Planets in this mass-range are different from their more massive cousins in several ways that are relevant to their radiative properties and thermal structures By analogy with Neptune and Uranus
they are likely to have metal abundances that are an order of magnitude or more greater than those of larger more massive planets This increases their opacity decreases Rayleigh scattering and changes their equation of state Furthermore their smaller radii mean that fluxes from these planets are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of otherwise identical gas giant planets
Here we compute a range of plausible radiative equilibrium models of GJ436b and HAT-P-11b In addition we explore the dependence of generic Neptune-mass planets on a range of physical properties including their distance from their host stars their metallicity the spectral type of their stars the redistribution of heat in their atmospheres
Using the NICMOS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope we have measured the dayside spectrum of HD 209458b between 1 5--2 5 microns The emergent spectrum is dominated by features due to the presence of methane (CH4) and water vapor (H2O) with smaller contributions from carbon dioxide (CO2) Combining this near-infrared spectrum with existing mid-infrared measurements shows the existence of a temperature inversion and confirms the interpretation of previous photometry measurements
We find a family of plausible solutions for the molecular abundance and detailed temperature profile Observationally resolving the ambiguity between abundance and temperature requires either (1) improved wavelength coverage or spectral resolution of the dayside emission spectrum or (2) a transmission spectrum where abundance determinations are less sensitive to the temperature structure
Debris disks are evidence that stars harbor reservoirs of dust-producing plantesimals on spatial scales similar the solar system Debris disks present a wide range of sizes and structural features and there is growing evidence that in some cases they might be the result of the dynamical perturbations of a massive planet
Our solar system also harbors a debris disk and some of its properties resemble those of extra-solar debris disks This contribution discusses how the study of debris disks with SPICA can shed light on the diversity of planetary systems the link between debris disks and planets and the link between extra-solar planetary systems and our own
As of August 2008 over 30 multiple exoplanet systems are known and 28% of stars with planets show significant evidence of a second companion I briefly review these 30 systems individually broadly grouping them into five categories 1) systems with 3 or more giant (Msini &gt; 0 2 M_Jup) planets
having two giant planets with very large period ratios (&gt; 30 1) and 5) systems of ``Super-Earths&#39;&#39; containing only planets with (Msini &lt; 20 M_Earth) <br>It now appears that eccentricities are not markedly higher among planets in known multiple planet systems and that planets with Msini &lt; 1 M_Jup have lower eccentricities than more massive planets
Given the tendency of planets to form in multiples and the observational evidence in support of the existence of potential planet-hosting stars in binaries or clusters it is expected that extrasolar terrestrial planes are more likely to be found in multiple body systems This paper discusses the prospects of the detection of terrestrial/habitable planets in multibody systems by presenting the results of a study of the long-term stability of these objects in systems with multiple giant planets (particularly those in eccentric and/or in mean-motion resonant orbits)
systems with close-in Jupiter-like bodies and systems of binary stars The results of simulations show that while short-period terrestrial-class objects that are captured in near mean-motion resonances with migrating giant planets are potentially detectable via transit photometry or the measurement of the variations of the transit-timing due to their close-in Jovian-mass planetary companions
Using the period and mass data of two hundred and seventy-nine extrasolar planets we have constructed a coupled period-mass function through the non-parametric approach This analytic expression of the coupled period-mass function has been obtained for the first time in this field Moreover due to a moderate period-mass correlation the shapes of mass/period functions vary as a function of period/mass
We study the orbits tidal heating and mass loss from satellites around close-in gas giant exoplanets The focus is on large satellites which are potentially observable by their transit signature We argue that even Earth-size satellites around hot Jupiters may be immune to destruction by orbital decay; detection of such a massive satellite would strongly constrain theories of tidal dissipation in gas giants
in a manner complementary to orbital circularization The star&#39;s gravity induces significant periodic eccentricity in the satellite&#39;s orbit The resulting tidal heating rates per unit mass are far in excess of Io&#39;s and dominate radioactive heating out to planet orbital periods of months for reasonable satellite tidal $Q$ Inside planet orbital periods of about a week
tidal heating can completely melt the satellite Lastly we compute an upper limit to the satellite mass loss rate due to thermal evaporation from the surface valid if the satellite&#39;s atmosphere is thin and vapor pressure is negligible Using this upper limit we find that although rocky satellites around hot Jupiters with orbital periods less than a few days can be significantly evaporated in their lifetimes
We present calculations of magnetic potential associated with the perturbation of Saturn&#39;s magnetic field by a rotating equatorially-situated disc of plasma Such structures are central to the dynamics of the rapidly rotating magnetospheres of Saturn and Jupiter They are `fed&#39; internally by sources of plasma from moons such as Enceladus (Saturn) and Io (Jupiter)
We use a scaled form of Euler potentials for the Jovian magnetodisc field (Caudal 1986) In this formalism the magnetic field is assumed to be azimuthally symmetric about the planet&#39;s axis of rotation and plasma temperature is constant along a field line We perturb the dipole potential by using simplified distributions of plasma pressure and angular velocity for both planets
based on observations by Cassini (Saturn) and Voyager (Jupiter) Our results quantify the degree of radial `stretching&#39; exerted on the dipolar field lines through the plasma&#39;s rotational motion and pressure A simplified version of the field model the `homogeneous disc&#39; can be used to easily estimate the distance of transition in the outer magnetosphere between pressure-dominated and centrifugally-dominated disc structure
We comment on the degree of equatorial confinement as represented by the scale height associated with disc ions of varying mass and temperature For Saturn we identify the principal forces which contribute to the magnetodisc current and make comparisons between the field structure predicted by the model and magnetic field measurements from Cassini
The hot Jupiter HD 209458b was observed during primary transit at 3 6 4 5 5 8 and 8 0 microns using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope We detail here the procedures we adopted to correct for the systematic trends present in the IRAC data
The light curves were fitted including limb darkening effects and fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and prayer-bead Monte Carlo techniques finding almost identical results The final depth measurements obtained by a combined Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit are at 3 6 microns 1 469 +- 0 013 % and 1
Our results clearly indicate the presence of water in the planetary atmosphere Our broad band photometric measurements with IRAC prevent us from determining the additional presence of other other molecules such as CO CO2 and methane for which spectroscopy is needed While water vapour with a mixing ratio of 10^-4-10^-3 combined with thermal profiles retrieved from the day-side may provide a very good fit to our observations
One class of protoplanetary disc models the X-wind model predicts strongly subkeplerian orbital gas velocities a configuration that can be sustained by magnetic tension We investigate disc-planet interactions in these subkeplerian discs focusing on orbital migration for low-mass planets and gap formation for high-mass planets We use linear calculations and nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations to measure the torque and look at gap formation
In both cases the subkeplerian nature of the disc is treated as a fixed external constraint We show that depending on the degree to which the disc is subkeplerian the torque on low-mass planets varies between the usual Type I torque and the one-sided outer Lindblad torque which is also negative but an order of magnitude stronger
In strongly subkeplerian discs corotation effects can be ignored making migration fast and inward Gap formation near the planet&#39;s orbit is more difficult in such discs since there are no resonances close to the planet accommodating angular momentum transport In stead the location of the gap is shifted inwards with respect to the planet
This report arises from an ongoing program to monitor Neptune&#39;s largest moon Triton spectroscopically in the 0 8 to 2 4 micron range using IRTF/SpeX Our objective is to search for changes on Triton&#39;s surface as witnessed by changes in the infrared absorption bands of its surface ices N2 CH4
H2O CO and CO2 We have recorded infrared spectra of Triton on 53 nights over the ten apparitions from 2000 through 2009 The data generally confirm our previously reported diurnal spectral variations of the ice absorption bands (Grundy &amp; Young 2004) Nitrogen ice shows a large amplitude variation with much stronger absorption on Triton&#39;s Neptune-facing hemisphere
We present evidence for seasonal evolution of Triton&#39;s N2 ice the 2 15 micron absorption band appears to be diminishing especially on the Neptune-facing hemisphere Although it is mostly dissolved in N2 ice Triton&#39;s CH4 ice shows a very different longitudinal variation from the N2 ice challenging assumptions of how the two ices behave
Unlike Triton&#39;s CH4 ice the CO ice does exhibit longitudinal variation very similar to the N2 ice implying that CO and N2 condense and sublimate together maintaining a consistent mixing ratio Absorptions by H2O and CO2 ices show negligible variation as Triton rotates implying very uniform and/or high latitude spatial distributions for those two non-volatile ices
We present the results of detailed dynamical simulations of the effect of the migration of the four giant planets on both the transport of pre-formed Neptune Trojans and the capture of new Trojans from a trans-Neptunian disk We find that scenarios involving the slow migration of Neptune over a large distance (50Myr to migrate from 18
Scenarios with faster migration (5Myr) and those in which Neptune migrates from 23 1AU to its current location fail to adequately reproduce the current day Trojan population Scenarios which avoid disruptive perturbation events between Uranus and Neptune fail to yield any significant excitation of pre-formed Trojans (transported with efficiencies between 30 and 98% whilst maintaining the dynamically cold nature of these objects)
Conversely scenarios with periods of strong Uranus-Neptune perturbation lead to the almost complete loss of such pre-formed objects In these cases a small fraction (~0 15%) of these escaped objects are later recaptured as Trojans prior to the end of migration with a wide range of eccentricities (&lt;0 35) and inclinations (&lt;40 deg)
In all scenarios (including those with such disruptive interaction between Uranus and Neptune) the capture of objects from the trans-Neptunian disk (through which Neptune migrates) is achieved with efficiencies between ~0 1 and ~1% The captured Trojans display a wide range of inclinations (&lt;40 deg for slow migration and &lt;20 deg for rapid migration) and eccentricities (&lt;0
Main-sequence stars earlier than spectral type ~F6 or so are expected to rotate rapidly due to their radiative exteriors This rapid rotation leads to an oblate stellar figure It also induces the photosphere to be hotter (by up to several thousand Kelvin) at the pole than at the equator as a result of a process called gravity darkening that was first predicted by von Zeipel (1924)
Transits of extrasolar planets across such a non-uniform oblate disk yield unusual and distinctive lightcurves that can be used to determine the relative alignment of the stellar rotation pole and the planet orbit normal This spin-orbit alignment can be used to constrain models of planet formation and evolution Orderly planet formation and migration within a disk that is coplanar with the stellar equator will result in spin-orbit alignment
More violent planet-planet scattering events should yield spin-orbit misaligned planets Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of transits of lower-mass stars show that some planets are spin-orbit aligned and some are not Since Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements are difficult around rapid rotators lightcurve photometry may be the best way to determine the spin-orbit alignment of planets around massive stars
We consider the formation and migration of protoplanetary embryos in disks around the stars in tight binary systems (separations ~ 20 AU In such systems the initial stages of runaway embryo formation are expected to only take place within some critical disk radius a_{crit} due to the perturbing effect of the binary companions (Thebault et al
We perform n-body simulations of the evolution of such a population of inner-disk embryos surrounded by an outer-disk of smaller planetesimals Taking Alpha Centauri-B as our fiducial reference example in which a_{crit} ~ 0 7 AU and using a Minimum Mass Nebular Model with $\Sigma \propto a^{-3/2}$ we find that within 10^6 yrs (10^7 yrs)
systems will on average contain embryos which have migrated out to 0 9 AU (1 2 AU) with the average outer-most body having a mass of 0 2 M_{earth} 0 4 M_{earth} Changes to increase the surface density of solids or to use a flatter profile both produce increased embryo migration and growth
At a given time the relative change in semi-major axis of the outer-most embryo in these simulations is found to be essentially independent of a_{crit} and we note that little further embryo migration takes place beyond 10^7 years We conclude that the suppression of runaway growth outside a_{crit} does not mean that the habitable zones in such tight binary systems will be devoid of detectable
The origins of planets and perhaps life itself is intrinsically linked to the chemistry of planet formation In this chapter we will attempt to explore the chemistry of planet-forming disks from the perspective of knowledge gained from decades of solar system study combined with our rapidly growing knowledge of extra-solar protoplanetary disks
Our aim is not to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature but rather to present the chemical and physical tools that are used to explore chemical evolution during the earliest stages of planet formation We include a discussion of observational constraints from our solar system and extra-solar disks thermodynamic equilibrium and chemical kinetics
We present preliminary results of the first and on-going radial velocity survey for circumbinary planets With a novel radial velocity technique employing an iodine absorption cell we achieve an unprecedented RV precision of up to 2 m/s for double-lined binary stars The high resolution spectra collected with the Keck I/Hires
TNG/Sarg and Shane/CAT/Hamspec telescopes/spectrographs over the years 2003-2008 allow us to derive RVs and compute planet detection limits for ten double-lined binary stars For this initial sample of targets we can rule out planets on dynamically stable orbits with masses as small as ~0 3 to 3 MJup for the orbital periods of up to ~5
We analyze the precursor of a Forbush Decrease (FD) observed with the Global Muon Detector Network on December 14 2006 An intense geomagnetic storm is also recorded during this FD with the peak Kp index of 8+ By using the &#34;two-dimensional map&#34; of the cosmic ray intensity produced after removing the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy
we succeed in extracting clear signatures of the precursor A striking feature of this event is that a weak loss-cone signature is first recorded more than a day prior to the Storm Sudden Commencement (SSC) onset This suggests that the loss-cone precursor appeared only 7 hours after the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) eruption from the Sun
when the Interplanetary (IP) shock driven by the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) located at 0 4 AU from the Sun We find the precursor being successively observed with multiple detectors in the network according to the Earth&#39;s spin and confirmed that the precursor continuously exists in space The long lead time (15
The amplitude (-6 45 %) of the loss-cone anisotropy at the SSC onset is more than twice the FD size indicating that the maximum intensity depression behind the IP shock is much larger than the FD size recorded at the Earth in this event We also find the excess intensity from the sunward IMF direction clearly observed during ~10 hours preceding the SSC onset
Four of nine exoplanets found by microlensing were detected by the resonant caustic which represents the merging of the planetary and central caustics at the position when the projected separation of a host star and a bounded planet is s~1 One of the resonant caustic lensing events OGLE-2005-BLG-169 was a caustic-crossing high-magnification event with $A_{max} \sim$ 800 and the source star was much smaller than the caustic
nevertheless the perturbation was not obviously apparent on the light curve of the event In this paper we investigate the perturbation pattern of the resonant caustic to understand why the perturbations induced by the caustic do not leave strong traces on the light curves of high-magnification events despite a small source/caustic size ratio
From this study we find that the regions with small-magnification-excess around the center of the resonant caustic are rather widely formed and the event passing the small-excess region produces a high-magnification event with a weak perturbation that is small relative to the amplification caused by the star and thus does not noticeably appear on the light curve of the event
We also find that the positive excess of the inside edge of the resonant caustic and the negative excess inside the caustic become stronger and wider as $q$ increases and thus the resonant caustic-crossing high-magnification events with the weak perturbation occur in the range of $q \leqslant 10^{-4}$ We determine the probability of the occurrence of events with the small excess $|\epsilon| \leqslant 3 %$ in high-magnification events induced by a resonant caustic
There has not been a comprehensive framework for comparing spectral data from different <a href="http //planets Such" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> a framework is needed for the study of extrasolar planets and objects within the solar system We have undertaken observations to compile a library of planet spectra for all planets
some moons and some dwarf planets in the solar system to study their general spectroscopic and photometric natures During May and November of 2008 we acquired spectra for the planets using TRISPEC which is capable of simultaneous three-band spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range of 0 45 - 2 5 microns with low resolving power (lambda-over-Delta-lambda is 140 - 360)
Patterns emerge from comparing the spectra Analyzing their general spectroscopic and photometric natures we show that it is possible to distinguish between gas planets soil planets and ice planets These methods can be applied to extrasolar observations using low resolution spectrography or broad-band filters The present planet spectral library is the first library to contain observational spectra for all of the solar system planets
The Lidov-Kozai mechanism allows a body to periodically exchange its eccentricity with inclination It was first discussed in the framework of the quadrupolar secular restricted three-body problem where the massless particle is the inner body and later extended to the quadrupolar secular nonrestricted three body problem In this paper we propose a different point of view on the problem by looking first at the restricted problem where the massless particle is the outer body
In this situation equilibria at high mutual inclination appear which correspond to the population of stable particles that Verrier &amp; Evans (2008 2009) find in stable high inclination circumbinary orbits around one of the components of the quadruple star HD 98800 We provide a simple analytical framework using a vectorial formalism for these situations
We use signal enhancement techniques and a matched filter analysis to search for the K band spectroscopic absorption signature of the close orbiting extrasolar giant planet HD 189733b With timeseries observations taken with NIRSPEC at the Keck II telescope we investigate the relative abundances of H2O and carbon bearing molecules
which have now been identified in the dayside spectrum of HD 189733b We detect a candidate planet signature with a low level of significance close to the ~153 km/s velocity amplitude of HD 189733b However some systematic variations mainly due to imperfect telluric line removal remain in the residual spectral timeseries in which we search for the planetary signal
The robustness of our candidate signature is assessed enabling us to conclude that it is not possible to confirm the presence of any planetary signal which appears at Fp/F* contrasts deeper than the 95 4 per cent confidence level Our search does not enable us to detect the planet at a contrast ratio of Fp/F* = 1/1920 with 99
We also investigate the effect of model uncertainties on our ability to reliably recover a planetary signal The use of incorrect temperature model opacity wavelengths and model temperature-pressure profiles have important consequences for the least squares deconvolution procedure that we use to boost the S/N ratio in our spectral timeseries observations
We present new JHK spectroscopy (R ~ 5000) of GQ Lup b acquired with the near-infrared integral field spectrograph NIFS and the adaptive optics system ALTAIR at the Gemini North telescope Angular differential imaging was used in the J and H bands to suppress the speckle noise from GQ Lup A; we show that this approach can provide improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by a factor of 2 - 6 for companions located at subarcsecond separations
Based on high quality observations and GAIA synthetic spectra we estimate the companion effective temperature to Teff = 2400 +/- 100 K its gravity to log g = 4 0 +/- 0 5 and its luminosity to log(L/L_s) = -2 47 +/- 0 28 Comparisons with the predictions of the DUSTY evolutionary tracks allow us to constrain the mass of GQ Lup b to 8 - 60 MJup
most likely in the brown dwarf regime Compared with the spectra published by Seifahrt and collaborators our spectra of GQ Lup b are significantly redder (by 15 - 50%) and do not show important Pa\beta emission Our spectra are in excellent agreement with the lower S/N spectra previously published by McElwain and collaborators
The irradiation of protoplanetary discs by central stars is the main heating mechanism for discs resulting in their flared geometric structure In a series of papers we investigate the deep links between 2D self-consistent disc structure and planetary migration in irradiated discs focusing particularly on those around M stars In this first paper
we analyse the thermal structure of discs that are irradiated by an M star by solving the radiative transfer equation by means of a Monte Carlo code Our simulations of irradiated hydrostatic discs are realistic and self-consistent in that they include dust settling with multiple grain sizes (N=15) the gravitational force of an embedded planet on the disc
and the presence of a dead zone (a region with very low levels of turbulence) within it We show that dust settling drives the temperature of the mid-plane from an $r^{-3/5}$ distribution (well mixed dust models) toward an $r^{-3/4}$ The dead zone meanwhile leaves a dusty wall at its outer edge because dust settling in this region is enhanced compared to the active turbulent disc at larger disc radii
The disc heating produced by this irradiated wall provides a positive gradient region of the temperature in the dead zone in front of the wall This is crucially important for slowing planetary migration because Lindblad torques are inversely proportional to the disc temperature Furthermore we show that low turbulence of the dead zone is self-consistently induced by dust settling
We present models of giant planet migration in evolving protoplanetary disks Our disks evolve subject to viscous transport of angular momentum and photoevaporation while planets undergo Type II migration We use a Monte Carlo approach running large numbers of models with a range in initial conditions We find that relatively simple models can reproduce both the observed radial distribution of extra-solar giant planets
and the lifetimes and accretion histories of protoplanetary disks The use of state-of-the-art photoevaporation models results in a degree of coupling between planet formation and disk clearing which has not been found previously Some accretion across planetary orbits is necessary if planets are to survive at radii &lt;~1 5AU and if planets of Jupiter mass or greater are to survive in our models they must be able to form at late times
when the disk surface density in the formation region is low Our model forms two different types of &#34;transitional&#34; disks embedded planets and clearing disks which show markedly different properties We find that the observable properties of these systems are broadly consistent with current observations and highlight useful observational diagnostics
Planetesimal formation is a common by-product of the star formation process Taking the dynamical history of the Solar system as a guideline -- in which the planetesimal belts were heavily depleted due to graviational perburbation with the giant planets -- and assuming similar processes have take place in other planetary systems
one would expect the interestellar space to be filled with extra-solar planetesimals However not a single one of these objects has been detected so far entering the Solar system even though it would clearly be distinguishable from a Solar system comet due to its highly hyperbolic orbit The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will provide wide coverage maps of the sky to a very high sensitivity
ideal to detect moving objects like comets both active and inactive In anticipation of these observations we estimate how many inactive &#34;interstellar comets&#34; might be detected during the duration of the survey The calculation takes into account estimates (from observations and models) of the number density of stars the amount of solids available to form planetesimals
We present results of visible wavelengths spectroscopic measurements (0 45 to 0 72 microns) of two binary asteroids obtained with the 1-m telescope at the Wise Observatory on January 2008 The asteroids (90) Antiope and (1509) Esclangona were observed to search for spectroscopic variations correlated with their rotation while presenting different regions of their surface to the viewer
Simultaneous photometric observations were performed with the Wise Observatory&#39;s 0 46-m telescope to investigate the rotational phase behavior and possible eclipse events (90) Antiope displayed an eclipse event during our observations We could not measure any slope change of the spectroscopic albedo within the error range of 3% except for a steady decrease in the total light flux while the eclipse took place
We conclude that the surface compositions of the two components do not differ dramatically implying a common origin and history (1509) Esclangona did not show an eclipse but rather a unique lightcurve with three peaks and a wide and flat minimum repeating with a period of 3 2524 hours Careful measurements of the spectral albedo slopes reveal a color variation of 7 to 10 percent on the surface of (1509) Esclangona
Planets are built from planetesimals solids larger than a kilometer which grow by colliding pairwise Planetesimals themselves are unlikely to form by two-body collisions; sub-km objects have gravitational fields individually too weak and electrostatic attraction is too feeble for growth beyond a few cm We review the possibility that planetesimals form when self-gravity brings together vast ensembles of small particles
Even when self-gravity is weak aerodynamic processes can accumulate solids relative to gas paving the way for gravitational collapse Particles pile up as they drift radially inward Gas turbulence stirs particles but can also seed collapse by clumping them While the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical shear instabilities that obstruct self-gravity
We demonstrate the newly developed resource for exoplanet researchers - The Exoplanet Transit Database This database is designed to be a web application and it is open for any exoplanet observer It came on-line in September 2008 The ETD consists of three individual sections One serves for predictions of the transits
the second one for processing and uploading new data from the observers We use a simple analytical model of the transit to calculate the central time of transit its duration and the depth of the transit These values are then plotted into the observed - computed diagrams (O-C) that represent the last part of the application
We present here the results of our observations of TrES-2 using the Infrared Array Camera on Spitzer We monitored this transiting system during two secondary eclipses when the planetary emission is blocked by the star The resulting decrease in flux is 0 127%+-0 021% 0 230%+-0 024% 0 199%+-0 054%
and 0 359%+-0 060% at 3 6 microns 4 5 microns 5 8 microns and 8 0 microns respectively We show that three of these flux contrasts are well fit by a black body spectrum with T_{eff}=1500 K as well as by a more detailed model spectrum of a planetary atmosphere
The observed planet-to-star flux ratios in all four IRAC channels can be explained by models with and without a thermal inversion in the atmosphere of TrES-2 although with different atmospheric chemistry Based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium the chemical composition of the inversion model seems more plausible making it a more favorable scenario
TrES-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiated planets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions However more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be needed to confirm a thermal inversion in this system Furthermore we find that the times of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published times of transit and the expectation from a circular orbit
High-contrast imaging observations of large angular diameter stars enable complementary science questions to be addressed compared to the baseline goals of proposed missions like the Terrestrial Planet Finder-Coronagraph New World&#39;s Observer and others Such targets however present a practical problem in that finite stellar size results in unwanted starlight reaching the detector
which degrades contrast In this paper we quantify the sensitivity in terms of contrast of an internally-occulting space-based coronagraph as a function of stellar angular diameter from unresolved dwarfs to the largest evolved stars Our calculations show that an assortment of band-limited image masks can accommodate a diverse set of observations to help maximize mission scientific return
We discuss two applications based on the results the spectro-photometric study of planets already discovered with the radial velocity technique to orbit evolved stars which we elucidate with the example of Pollux b and the direct detection of planets orbiting our closest neighbor Alpha Centauri whose primary component is on the main-sequence but subtends an appreciable angle on the sky
In this paper we select large spectral averages of data from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) obtained in limb-viewing mode at low latitudes (30S--30N) greatly increasing the path length and hence signal-to-noise ratio for optically thin trace species such as propane By modeling and subtracting the emissions of other gas species
we demonstrate that at least six infrared bands of propane are detected by CIRS including two not previously identified in Titan spectra Using a new line list for the range 1300-1400cm -1 along with an existing GEISA list we retrieve propane abundances from two bands at 748 and 1376 cm-1
At 748 cm-1 we retrieve 4 2 +/- 0 5 x 10(-7) (1-sigma error) at 2 mbar in good agreement with previous studies although lack of hotbands in the present spectral atlas remains a problem We also determine 5 7 +/- 0 8 x 10(-7) at 2 mbar from the 1376 cm-1 band - a value that is probably affected by systematic errors including continuum gradients due to haze and also an imperfect model of the n6 band of ethane
This study clearly shows for the first time the ubiquity of propane&#39;s emission bands across the thermal infrared spectrum of Titan and points to an urgent need for further laboratory spectroscopy work both to provide the line positions and intensities needed to model these bands and also to further characterize haze spectral opacity
Using numerical simulations we show that smooth migration of the giant planets through a planetesimal disk leads to an orbital architecture that is inconsistent with the current one the resulting eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits are too small The crossing of mutual mean motion resonances by the planets would excite their orbital eccentricities but not their orbital inclinations
Moreover the amplitudes of the eigenmodes characterising the current secular evolution of the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn would not be reproduced correctly; only one eigenmode is excited by resonance-crossing We show that at the very least encounters between Saturn and one of the ice giants (Uranus or Neptune) need to have occurred
We have obtained a full suite of Spitzer observations to characterize the debris disk around HR 8799 and to explore how its properties are related to the recently discovered set of three massive planets orbiting the star We distinguish three components to the debris system (1) warm dust (T ~150 K) orbiting within the innermost planet; (2) a broad zone of cold dust (T ~45 K) with a sharp inner edge
orbiting just outside the outermost planet and presumably sculpted by it; and (3) a dramatic halo of small grains originating in the cold dust component The high level of dynamical activity implied by this halo may arise due to enhanced gravitational stirring by the massive planets The relatively young age of HR 8799 places it in an important early stage of development and may provide some help in understanding the interaction of planets and planetary debris
We present the discovery of a brown dwarf or possible planet at a projected separation of 1 9&#34; = 29 AU around the star GJ 758 placing it between the separations at which substellar companions are expected to form by core accretion (~5 AU) or direct gravitational collapse (typically &gt;100 AU)
The object was detected by direct imaging of its thermal glow with Subaru/HiCIAO At 10-40 times the mass of Jupiter and a temperature of 550-640 K GJ 758 B constitutes one of the few known T-type companions and the coldest ever to be imaged in thermal light around a Sun-like star
The differential migration of two planets due to planet-disk interaction can result in capture into the 2 1 eccentricity-type mean-motion resonances Both the sequence of 2 1 eccentricity resonances that the system is driven through by continued migration and the possibility of a subsequent capture into the 4 2 inclination resonances are sensitive to the migration rate within the range expected for type II migration
If the migration rate is fast the resonant pair can evolve into a family of 2 1 eccentricity resonances different from those found by Lee (2004) This new family has outer orbital eccentricity e_2 &gt; 0 4-0 5 asymmetric librations of both eccentricity resonance variables and orbits that intersect if they are exactly coplanar
Although this family exists for an inner-to-outer planet mass ratio m_1/m_2 &gt; 0 2 it is possible to evolve into this family by fast migration only for m_1/m_2 &gt; 2 Thommes and Lissauer (2003) have found that a capture into the 4 2 inclination resonances is possible only for m_1/m_2 &lt; 2
We show that this capture is also possible for m_1/m_2 &gt; 2 if the migration rate is slightly slower than that adopted by Thommes and Lissauer There is significant theoretical uncertainty in both the sign and the magnitude of the net effect of planet-disk interaction on the orbital eccentricity of a planet
If the eccentricity is damped on a timescale comparable to or shorter than the migration timescale e_2 may not be able to reach the values needed to enter either the new 2 1 eccentricity resonances or the 4 2 inclination resonances Thus if future observations of extrasolar planetary systems were to reveal certain combinations of mass ratio and resonant configuration
The aim of this talk is to present the most recent advances in establishing plausible planetary system architectures determined by the gravitational tidal interactions between the planets and the disc in which they are embedded during the early epoch of planetary system formation We concentrate on a very well defined and intensively studied process of the disc-planet interaction leading to the planet migration
We focus on the dynamics of the systems in which low-mass planets are present Particular attention is devoted to investigation of the role of resonant configurations Our studies apart from being complementary to the fast progress occurring just now in observing the whole variety of planetary systems and uncovering their structure and origin
The distribution of interstellar dust grains (ISDG) observed in the Solar System depends on the nature of the interstellar medium-solar wind interaction The charge of the grains couples them to the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) resulting in some fraction of grains being excluded from the heliosphere while grains on the larger end of the size distribution
with gyroradii comparable to the size of the heliosphere penetrate the termination shock This results in a skewing the size distribution detected in the Solar System <br>We present new calculations of grain trajectories and the resultant grain density distribution for small ISDGs propagating through the heliosphere We make use of detailed heliosphere model results
using three-dimensional (3-D) magnetohydrodynamic/kinetic models designed to match data on the shape of the termination shock and the relative deflection of interstellar neutral H and He flowing into the heliosphere We find that the necessary inclination of the ISMF relative to the inflow direction results in an asymmetry in the distribution of the larger grains (0
The recent discoveries of massive planets on ultra-wide orbits of HR 8799 (Marois et al 2008) and Fomalhaut (Kalas et al 2008) present a new challenge for planet formation theorists Our goal is to figure out which of three giant planet formation mechanisms--core accretion (with or without migration) scattering from the inner disk
or gravitational instability--could be responsible for Fomalhaut b HR 8799 b c and d and similar planets discovered in the future This paper presents the results of numerical experiments comparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible mechanism in model A star G star and M star disks <br>First
a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming beyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass even under the most favorable conditions one can construct Second a set of N-body simulations demonstrates that planet-planet scattering does not create stable wide-orbit systems such as HR 8799 Finally a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing that global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks
We conclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes greater than 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk We recommend that observers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age controlling for planet dimming with time If planet detection rate is found to be independent of stellar age
it would confirm our prediction that gravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets on wide orbits We also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period to short-period gas giants should be highest for M dwarfs due to the inefficiency of core accretion and the expected small fragment mass in their disks
(abridged) Aims We present new results exhibiting a subcritical baroclinic instability (SBI) in local shearing box models We describe the 2D and 3D behaviour of this instability using numerical simulations and we present a simple analytical model describing the underlying physical process <br>Results A subcritical baroclinic instability is observed in flows stable for the Solberg-Hoiland criterion using local simulations
This instability is found to be a nonlinear (or subcritical) instability which cannot be described by ordinary linear approaches It requires a radial entropy gradient weakly unstable for the Schwartzchild criterion and a strong thermal diffusivity (or equivalently a short cooling time) In compressible simulations the instability produces density waves which transport angular momentum outward with typically alpha&lt;3e-3
the exact value depending on the background temperature profile Finally the instability survives in 3D vortex cores becoming turbulent due to parametric instabilities <br>Conclusions The subcritical baroclinic instability is a robust phenomenon which can be captured using local simulations The instability survives in 3D thanks to a balance between the 2D SBI and 3D parametric instabilities
Rank-Ordered Multifractal Analysis (ROMA) a recently developed technique that combines the ideas of parametric rank ordering and one parameter scaling of monofractals has the capabilities of deciphering the multifractal characteristics of intermittent fluctuations The method allows one to understand the multifractal properties through rank-ordered scaling or non-scaling parametric variables The idea of the ROMA technique is applied to analyze the multifractal characteristics of the auroral zone electric field fluctuations observed by SIERRA
We use a 1D thermochemical and photochemical kinetics model to predict the disequilibrium stratospheric chemistries of warm and hot Jupiters (800 &lt; T &lt; 1200 K) Thermal chemistry and vertical mixing are generally more important than photochemistry At 1200 K methane is oxidized to CO and CO2 by OH radicals from thermal decomposition of water
At T &lt; 1000 K methane is reactive but stable enough to reach the stratosphere while water is stable enough that OH levels are suppressed by reaction with H2 These trends raise the effective C/O ratio in the reacting gases above unity Reduced products such as ethylene acetylene and hydrogen cyanide become abundant; further polymerization should lead to formation of PAHs (Poly-Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and soots
Parallel shifts are seen in the sulfur chemistry with CS and CS2 displacing S2 and HS as the interesting disequilibrium products Although lower temperature is a leading factor favoring hydrocarbons higher rates of vertical mixing lower metallicities and lower incident UV radiation also favor organic synthesis Acetylene (the first step toward PAHs) formation is especially favored by high eddy diffusion coefficients Kzz &gt; 10^10 cm2/s
In most cases planetary compositions inferred from transit observations will differ markedly from those inferred from reflected or emitted light from the same planet The peculiar properties of HD 189733b compared to other hot Jupiters - a broadband blue haze little sign of Na or K and hints of low metallicity - can be explained by an organic haze if the planet is cool enough
In this study we address the question under which conditions a saturated velocity field stemming from geodynamo simulations leads to an exponential growth of the magnetic field in a corresponding kinematic calculation We perform global self-consistent geodynamo simulations and calculate the evolution of a kinematically advanced tracer field The self-consistent velocity field enters the induction equation in each time step
but the tracer field does not contribute to the Lorentz force This experiment has been performed by Cattaneo &amp; Tobias (2009) and is closely related to the test field method by Schrinner et al (2005 2007) We find two dynamo regimes in which the tracer field either grows exponentially or approaches a state aligned with the actual self-consistent magnetic field after an initial transition period
Both regimes can be distinguished by the Rossby number and coincide with the dipolar and multipolar dynamo regimes identified by Christensen &amp; Aubert (2006) Dipolar dynamos with low Rossby number are kinematically stable whereas the tracer field grows exponentially in the multipolar dynamo regime This difference in the saturation process for dynamos in both regimes comes along with differences in their time variability
Within our sample of 20 models solely kinematically unstable dynamos show dipole reversals and large excursions The complicated time behaviour of these dynamos presumably relates to the alternating growth of several competing dynamo modes On the other hand dynamos in the low Rossby number regime exhibit a rather simple time dependence and their saturation merely results in a fluctuation of the fundamental dynamo mode about its critical state
We continue former work on the modeling of potential effects of Gamma Ray Bursts on Phanerozoic Earth We focus on global biospheric effects of ozone depletion and show a first modeling of the spectral reduction of light by NO2 formed in the stratosphere We also illustrate the current complexities involved in the prediction of how terrestrial ecosystems would respond to this kind of burst
We present results of thermal evolution calculations for objects originating in the Kuiper belt and transferring inwards to the region of the outer planets Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are considered to be part of a reservoir that supplies the flux of small icy bodies mainly Centaurs and Jupiter-family comets to regions interior to the orbit of Neptune
We study the internal thermal evolution for yr of three typical KBOs and use the end state of the simulation as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations of two typical Centaurs Some evolutionary trends can be identified for the KBOs depending on key physical parameters such as size and composition The subsequent evolution in the Centaur region results in both specific features for each modeled object (mainly surface and sub-surface composition) and common characteristics of thermally evolved Centaurs
Krasinsky and Brumberg (2004 Celest Mech Dyn Astron 90 267) reported a secular increase of the astronomical unit (AU) of 15 meters per century Recently Miura et al (2009 PASJ 61) proposed that a possible angular momentum transfer from the rotation of the Sun to the orbital motion of the solar system planets may explain the observed increase of the AU
Aims The CoRoT space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12 000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search for transiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007 Deep transit signals can be detected quickly in the &#34;alarm-mode&#34; in parallel to the ongoing target field monitoring CoRoT&#39;s first planets have been detected in this mode
Methods The CoRoT raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals outliers and low-frequency stellar signals The phase folded lightcurve is used to fit the transit signal and derive the main planetary parameters Radial velocity follow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive the planet mass Results We report the detection of CoRoT-5b
detected during observations of the LRa01 field the first long-duration field in the galactic anticenter direction CoRoT-5b is a &#34;hot Jupiter-type&#34; planet with a radius of 1 388(+0 046 -0 047) R_Jup a mass of 0 467(+0 047 -0 024) M_Jup and therefore a mean density of 0 217(+0 031
We present our analysis of the red-channel CoRoT data of CoRoT-2b A deep secondary eclipse is detected at a level of 1 02+-0 20 x10-4 which suggests that all of the planet-signal detected previously in white light by Alonso et al (2009) originates from the red channel CoRoT-2b is the coolest exoplanet that has been detected in the optical so far
In contrast to the other planets its measured brightness temperature of 2170+-55 K is significantly higher than its maximum hemisphere-averaged effective day-side temperature However it is not expected that a hot Jupiter radiates as a black body and its thermal spectrum can deviate significantly from a Planck curve We present models of the planet/star flux ratio as function of wavelength
which are calculated for a T/P profile in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium using a self-consistent atmosphere code These are compared with the CoRoT detection and with measurements at 4 5 and 8 um from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et al (2009) We estimate that reflected light contributes only at a 10-20% level to the total optical eclipse depth
The models allow for an &#39;extra absorber&#39; to be inserted at high altitude in the planet&#39;s atmosphere This produces a thermal inversion layer recently invoked to explain the photometric reversals and flux enhancements seen in some planets in the infrared In the 0 5-1 5 um wavelength range the model-spectra of planets with an extra absorber at high altitude
are relatively suppressed in flux compared to those without such absorber We therefore argue that in contrast to the other exoplanets detected in the optical so far CoRoT-2b may not exhibit a significant thermal inversion in its atmosphere causing its optical brightness temperature to be boosted above its maximum effective day-side temperature
We investigate a new theory of the origin of the irregular satellites of the giant planets capture of one member of a ~100-km binary asteroid after tidal disruption The energy loss from disruption is sufficient for capture but it cannot deliver the bodies directly to the observed orbits of the irregular satellites
Instead the long-lived capture orbits subsequently evolve inward due to interactions with a tenuous circumplanetary gas disk <br>We focus on the capture by Jupiter which due to its large mass provides the most stringent test of our model We investigate the possible fates of disrupted bodies the differences between prograde and retrograde captures
and the effects of Callisto on captured objects We make an impulse approximation and discuss how it allows us to generalize capture results from equal-mass binaries to binaries with arbitrary mass ratios <br>We find that at Jupiter binaries offer an increase of a factor of ~10 in the capture rate of 100-km objects as compared to single bodies
for objects separated by tens of radii that approach the planet on relatively low-energy trajectories These bodies are at risk of collision with Callisto but may be preserved by gas drag if their pericenters are raised quickly enough We conclude that our mechanism is as capable of producing large irregular satellites as previous suggestions
We used chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetic calculations to model chemistry of the volatiles released by heating different types of carbonaceous ordinary and enstatite chondritic material as a function of temperature and pressure Our results predict the composition of atmospheres formed by outgassing during accretion of the Earth and other terrestrial planets
Outgassing of CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material produces H2O-rich (steam) atmospheres in agreement with the results of impact experiments However outgassing of other types of chondritic material produces atmospheres dominated by other gases Outgassing of ordinary (H L LL) and high iron enstatite (EH) chondritic material yields H2-rich atmospheres with CO and H2O being the second and third most abundant gases
Outgassing of low iron enstatite (EL) chondritic material gives a CO-rich atmosphere with H2 CO2 and H2O being the next most abundant gases Outgassing of CV carbonaceous chondritic material gives a CO2-rich atmosphere with H2O being the second most abundant gas Our results predict that the atmospheres formed during accretion of the Earth and Mars were probably H2-rich unless the accreted material was dominantly CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material
The Cassini Division in Saturn&#39;s rings contains a series of eight named gaps three of which contain dense ringlets Observations of stellar occultations by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft have yielded ~40 accurate and precise measurements of the radial position of the edges of all of these gaps and ringlets
These data reveal suggestive patterns in the shapes of many of the gap edges the outer edges of the 5 gaps without ringlets are circular to within 1 km while the inner edges of 6 of the gaps are eccentric with apsidal precession rates consistent with those expected for eccentric orbits near each edge
Intriguingly the pattern speeds of these eccentric inner gap edges together with that of the eccentric Huygens ringlet form a series with a characteristic spacing of 0 06 degrees/day The two gaps with non-eccentric inner edges lie near first-order Inner Lindblad Resonances (ILRs) with moons One such edge is close to the 5
The other resonantly confined edge is the outer edge of the B ring which lies near the 2 1 Mimas ILR Detailed investigation of the B-ring-edge data confirm the presence of an m=2 perturbation on the B-ring edge but also suggest that this pattern moves or librates relative to Mimas
The B-ring edge also has an m=1 component that rotates around the planet at a rate close to the expected apsidal precession rate The pattern speeds of the eccentric edges in the Cassini Division can potentially be generated from various combinations of the pattern speeds of structures observed on the edge of the B ring
The zodiacal cloud is a thick circumsolar disk of small debris particles produced by asteroid collisions and comets Here we present a zodiacal cloud model based on the orbital properties and lifetimes of comets and asteroids and on the dynamical evolution of dust after ejection The model is quantitatively constrained by IRAS observations of thermal emission
but also qualitatively consistent with other zodiacal cloud observations We find that 85-95% of the observed mid-infrared emission is produced by particles from the Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and $&lt;$10% by dust from long period comets Asteroidal dust is found to be present at $&lt;$10% We suggest that spontaneous disruptions of JFCs
rather than the usual cometary activity driven by sublimating volatiles is the main mechanism that librates cometary particles into the zodiacal cloud Our results imply that JFC particles represent $\sim$85% of the total mass influx at Earth Since their atmospheric entry speeds are typically low ($\approx$14 5 km s$^{-1}$ mean for D=100-200 $\mu$m with $\approx$12 km s$^{-1}$ being the most common case)
many JFC grains should survive frictional heating and land on the Earth&#39;s surface This explains why most micrometeorites collected in antarctic ice have primitive carbonaceous composition The present mass of the inner zodiacal cloud at $&lt;$5 AU is estimated to be 1-$2\times10^{19}$ g mainly in D=100-200 $\mu$m particles The inner zodiacal cloud should have been $&gt;10^4$ times brighter during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) epoch $\approx$3
We discuss the interior structure and composition of giant planets and how this structure changes as these planets cool and contract over time Here we define giant planets as those that have an observable hydrogen-helium envelope which includes Jupiter-like planets which are predominantly H/He gas and Neptune-like planets which are predominantly composed of elements heavier than H/He
We describe the equations of state of planetary materials and the construction of static structural models and thermal evolution models We apply these models to transiting planets close to their parent stars as well as directly imaged planets far from their parent stars Mechanisms that have been postulated to inflate the radii of close-in transiting planets are discussed
We have developed a theoretical description of how of an asteroid&#39;s polarization-phase curve will be affected by the removal of the dust from the surface due to a size-dependent phenomenon such as radiation pressure-driven escape of levitated particles We test our calculations against new observations of four small (D ~ 1 km) near-Earth asteroids [(85236)
(142348) (162900) and 2006 SZ_217] obtained with the Dual Beam Imaging Polarimeter on the University of Hawaii&#39;s 2 2 m telescope as well as previous observations of (25143) Itokawa and (433) Eros We find that the polarization of the light reflected from an asteroid is controlled by the mineralogical and chemical composition of the surface and is independent of dust particle
We investigate mode coupling in a two dimensional compressible disc with radial stratification and differential rotation We employ the global radial scaling of linear perturbations and study the linear modes in the local shearing sheet approximation We employ a three-mode formalism and study the vorticity (W) entropy (S) and compressional (P) modes and their coupling properties
The system exhibits asymmetric three-mode coupling these include mutual coupling of S and P-modes S and W-modes and asymmetric coupling between the W and P-modes P-mode perturbations are able to generate potential vorticity through indirect three-mode coupling This process indicates that compressional perturbations can lead to the development of vortical structures and influence the dynamics of radially stratified hydrodynamic accretion and protoplanetary discs
The discovery of decay products of a short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) in the Allende meteorite led to the hypothesis that a supernova shock wave transported freshly synthesized SLRI to the presolar dense cloud core triggered its self-gravitational collapse and injected the SLRI into the core Previous multidimensional numerical calculations of the shock-cloud collision process showed that this hypothesis is plausible when the shock wave and dense cloud core are assumed to remain isothermal at ~10 K
but not when compressional heating to ~1000 K is assumed Our two-dimensional models (Boss et al 2008) with the FLASH2 5 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code have shown that a 20 km/sec shock front can simultaneously trigger collapse of a 1 solar mass core and inject shock wave material
provided that cooling by molecular species such as H2O CO and H2 is included Here we present the results for similar calculations with shock speeds ranging from 1 km/sec to 100 km/sec We find that shock speeds in the range from 5 km/sec to 70 km/sec are able to trigger the collapse of a 2
A feasibility study was carried out at the Astronomical Observatory of the Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley demonstrating that it is a well-poised site to conduct an upcoming observing campaign aimed at detecting small-size (R&lt;R_Neptune) transiting planets around nearby cool M dwarf stars Three known transiting planet systems were monitored from May to August 2009 with a 25 cm f/3
It has long been assumed that the planet Jupiter acts as a giant shield significantly lowering the impact rate of small bodies on the Earth However until recently very little work had been carried out examining the role played by Jupiter in determining the frequency of such collisions In this work
the third of a series of papers we examine the degree to which the impact rate on Earth resulting from the Oort cloud comets is enhanced or lessened by the presence of a giant planet in a Jupiter-like orbit in an attempt to more fully understand the impact regime under which life on Earth has developed
This paper presents the results of collisional evolution calculations for the Kuiper belt starting from an initial size distribution similar to that produced by accretion simulations of that region - a steep power-law large object size distribution that breaks to a shallower slope at r ~1-2 km with collisional equilibrium achieved for objects r ~0
We find that the break from the steep large object power-law causes a divot or depletion of objects at r ~10-20 km which in-turn greatly reduces the disruption rate of objects with r&gt; 25-50 km preserving the steep power-law behavior for objects at this size Our calculations demonstrate that the roll-over observed in the Kuiper belt size distribution is naturally explained as an edge of a divot in the size distribution; the radius at which the size distribution transitions away from the power-law
and the shape of the divot from our simulations are consistent with the size of the observed roll-over and size distribution for smaller bodies Both the kink radius and the radius of the divot center depend on the strength scaling law in the gravity regime for Kuiper belt objects These simulations suggest that the sky density of r ~1 km objects is ~10^6-10^7 objects per square degree
In this Letter we give new constraints on planet migration They were obtained under the assumption that Saturn&#39;s current obliquity is due to a capture in resonance with Neptune&#39;s ascending node If planet migration is too fast then Saturn crosses the resonance without being captured and it keeps a small obliquity
This scenario thus gives a lower limit on the migration time scale tau We found that this boundary depends strongly on Neptune&#39;s initial inclination For two different migration types we found that tau should be at least greater than 7 Myr This limit increases rapidly as Neptune&#39;s initial inclination decreases from 10 to 1 degree
To improve the planet detection efficiency current planetary microlensing experiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetary signals near the peak of lensing light curves However it is known that central perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it is important to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binary companions
In this paper we analyze the light curves of microlensing events OGLE-2007-BLG-137/MOA-2007-BLG-091 OGLE-2007-BLG-355/MOA-2007-BLG-278 and MOA-2007-BLG-199/OGLE-2007-BLG-419 for all of which exhibit short-term perturbations near the peaks of the light curves From detailed modeling of the light curves we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binary companions rather than planets
From close examination of the light curves combined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained from modeling we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurring at a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondary perturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be used for the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations
Analyses of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation maps made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have revealed anomalies not predicted by the standard inflationary cosmology In particular the power of the quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low and the quadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of the Solar system
It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky pollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may be the cause for these anomalies In this paper we simulate the thermal emission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials Spectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared observations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust cloud&#39;s physical characteristics
In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a flat CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14 mm) and to be invisible in the infrared light its particles must be macroscopic Silicate spheres from several millimetres in size and carbonaceous particles an order of magnitude smaller will suffice
According to our estimates of the abundance of such particles in the Zodiacal cloud and trans-neptunian belt yielding the optical depths of the order of 1E-7 for each cloud the Solar-system dust can well contribute 10 microKelvin (within an order of magnitude) in the microwaves This is not only intriguingly close to the magnitude of the anomalies (about 30 microKelvin)
The final composition of giant planets formed as a result of gravitational instability in the disk gas depends on their ability to capture solid material (planetesimals) during their &#39;pre-collapse&#39; stage when they are extended and cold and contracting quasi-statically The duration of the pre-collapse stage is inversely proportional roughly to the square of the planetary mass
so massive protoplanets have shorter pre-collapse timescales and therefore limited opportunity for planetesimal capture The available accretion time for protoplanets with masses of 3 5 7 and 10 Jupiter masses is found to be 7 82E4 2 62E4 1 17E4 and 5 67E3 years respectively The total mass that can be captured by the protoplanets depends on the planetary mass
planetesimal size the radial distance of the protoplanet from the parent star and the local solid surface density We consider three radial distances 24 38 and 68 AU similar to the radial distances of the planets in the system HR 8799 and estimate the mass of heavy elements that can be accreted
We investigate the survival of planetesimal discs over Gyr timescales using a unified approach that is applicable to all Keplerian discs of solid bodies -- dust grains asteroids planets etc Planetesimal discs can be characterized locally by four parameters surface density semi-major axis planetesimal size and planetesimal radial velocity dispersion
Any planetesimal disc must have survived all dynamical processes including gravitational instability dynamical chaos gravitational scattering physical collisions and radiation forces that would lead to significant evolution over its lifetime These processes lead to a rich set of constraints that strongly restrict the possible properties of long-lived discs Within this framework
A point source observed 8 AU in projection from beta Pictoris in L&#39; (3 8 micron) imaging in 2003 has been recently presented as a planet candidate Here we show the results of L&#39;-band adaptive optics imaging obtained at Keck Observatory in 2008 We do not detect beta Pic b beyond a limiting radius of 0
or 5 5 AU in projection from the star If beta Pic b is an orbiting planet then it has moved &gt;=0 12 arcsec (2 4 AU in projection) closer to the star in the five years separating the two epochs of observation We examine the range of orbital parameters consistent with the observations
including likely bounds from the locations of previously inferred planetesimal belts We find a family of low-eccentricity orbits with semimajor axes ~8-9 AU that are completely allowed as well as a broad region of orbits with e&lt;~0 2 a&gt;~10 AU that are allowed if the apparent motion of the planet was towards the star in 2003
We compare this allowed space with predictions of the planetary orbital elements from the literature Additionally we show how similar observations in the next several years can further constrain the space of allowed orbits Non-detections of the source through 2013 will exclude the interpretation of the candidate as a planet orbiting between the 6
We have investigated the evolution of a pair of interacting planets embedded in a gaseous disc considering the possibility of the resonant capture of a Super-Earth by a Jupiter mass gas giant First we have examined the situation where the Super-Earth is on the internal orbit and the gas giant on the external one
It has been found that the terrestrial planet is scattered from the disc or the gas giant captures the Super-Earth into an interior 3 2 or 4 3 mean-motion resonance The stability of the latter configurations depends on the initial planet positions and on eccentricity evolution The behaviour of the system is different if the Super-Earth is the external planet
We have found that instead of being captured in the mean-motion resonance the terrestrial planet is trapped at the outer edge of the gap opened by the gas giant This effect prevents the occurrence of the first order mean-motion commensurability These results are particularly interesting in light of recent exoplanet discoveries and provide predictions of what will become observationally testable in the near future
We analyse the potential migration of massive planets forming far away from an inner planetary system For this we follow the dynamical evolution of the orbital elements of a massive planet undergoing a dissipative process with a gas disc centred around the central sun We use a new method for post-Newtonian
high-precision integration of planetary systems containing a central sun by splitting the forces on a particle between a dominant central force and additional perturbations In this treatment which allows us to integrate with a very high-accuracy close encounters all gravitational forces are integrated directly without resorting to any simplifying approach
In this work we have compiled 37 692 observations of 27 periodic and non-periodic comets to create the secular light curves (SLCs) using 2 plots per comet The data has been reduced homogeneously Our overriding goal is to learn the properties of the ensemble of comets More than 30 parameters are listed
of which over ~20 are new and measured from the plots We define two ages for a comet using activity as a proxy the photometric age P-AGE and the time-age T-AGE It is shown that these two parameters are robust implying that the input data can have significant errors but P-AGE and T-AGE come out with small errors
This is due to their mathematical definition It is shown that P-AGE classifies comets by shape of their light curve The value of this Atlas is twofold The SLCs not only show what we know but also show what we do not know thus pointing the way to meaningful observations
Besides their scientific value these plots are useful for planning observations The SLCs have not been modeled and there is no cometary light curve standard model as there is for some variable stars (i e eclipsing binaries) Comets are classified by age and size In this way it is found that 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is a baby goliath comet
The cumulative effects of weak resonant and secular perturbations by the major planets produce chaotic behavior of asteroids on long timescales Dynamical chaos is the dominant loss mechanism for asteroids with diameters D &gt; 10 km in the current asteroid belt In a numerical analysis of the long term evolution of test particles in the main asteroid belt region
we find that the dynamical loss history of test particles from this region is well described with a logarithmic decay law In our simulations the loss rate function that is established at t = 1 My persists with little deviation to at least t = 4 Gy Our study indicates that the asteroid belt region has experienced a significant amount of depletion due to this dynamical erosion - having lost as much as ~50% of the large asteroids - since 1 My after the establishment of the current dynamical structure of the asteroid belt
Because the dynamical depletion of asteroids from the main belt is approximately logarithmic an equal amount of depletion occurred in the time interval 10-200 My as in 0 2-4 Gy roughly ~30% of the current number of large asteroids in the main belt over each interval We find that asteroids escaping from the main belt due to dynamical chaos have an Earth impact probability of ~0
Our model suggests that the rate of impacts from large asteroids has declined by a factor of 3 over the last 3 Gy and that the present-day impact flux of D &gt; 10 km objects on the terrestrial planets is roughly an order of magnitude less than estimates currently in use in crater chronologies and impact hazard risk assessments
The habitability of planets is strongly affected by impacts from comets and asteroids Indications from the ages of Moon rocks suggest that the inner Solar System experienced an increased rate of impacts roughly 3 8 Gya known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) Here we develop a model of how the Solar System would have appeared to a distant observer during its history based on the Nice model of Gomes et al
(2005) We compare our results with observed debris discs We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of these systems before the LHB Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution shows that such heavy bombardment events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of Sun-like stars
CoRoT the pioneer space-based transit search steadily provides thousands of high-precision light curves with continuous time sampling over periods of up to 5 months The transits of a planet perturbed by an additional object are not strictly periodic By studying the transit timing variations (TTVs) additional objects can be detected in the system
<br>A transit timing analysis of CoRoT-1b is carried out to constrain the existence of additional planets in the system <br>We used data obtained by an improved version of the CoRoT data pipeline (version 2 0) Individual transits were fitted to determine the mid-transit times and we analyzed the derived $O-C$ diagram
N-body integrations were used to place limits on secondary planets <br>No periodic timing variations with a period shorter than the observational window (55 days) are found The presence of an Earth-mass Trojan is not likely A planet of mass greater than $\sim 1$ Earth mass can be ruled out by the present data if the object is in a 2
Radial velocities measured from near-infrared spectra are a potentially powerful tool to search for planets around cool stars and sub-stellar objects However no technique currently exists that yields near-infrared radial velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible We describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of these stars from K-band spectra
The method makes use of a glass cell filled with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the &#34;iodine cell&#34; technique that has been used very successfully in the visible Stellar spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell
convolved with a variable instrumental profile model A complicating factor is that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines The telluric lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory
The free parameters in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum the instrumental profile adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the atmospheric model telluric spectrum Doppler shift and stellar Doppler shift Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for late M dwarfs over six months demonstrate that precisions of ~5 m/s are obtainable over long timescales
Long-period transiting exoplanets provide an opportunity to study the mass-radius relation and internal structure of extrasolar planets Their studies grant insights into planetary evolution akin to the Solar System planets which in contrast to hot Jupiters are not constantly exposed to the intense radiation of their parent stars Observations of secondary eclipses allow investigations of exoplanet temperatures and large-scale exo-atmospheric properties
We survey the basic principles of atmospheric dynamics relevant to explaining existing and future observations of exoplanets both gas giant and terrestrial Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres our approach is to emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets
We begin by presenting the hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics including the Navier-Stokes primitive shallow-water and two-dimensional nondivergent models We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics including the importance of planetary rotation the concept of balance and scaling arguments to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west banding on rotating planets
We next turn to issues specific to giant planets including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures the implications for their wind patterns and mechanisms to pump their east-west jets Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention as these close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres
We then turn to the basic elements of circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies including Hadley cells jet streams processes that govern the large-scale horizontal temperature contrasts and climate and we discuss how these insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets Although exoplanets surely possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in our Solar System
Magnetic reconnection (MR) in Earth&#39;s magnetotail is usually followed by a systemwide redistribution of explosively released kinetic and thermal energy Recently multispacecraft observations from the THEMIS mission were used to study localized explosions associated with MR in the magnetotail so as to understand subsequent Earthward propagation of MR outbursts during substorms
Here we investigate plasma and magnetic field fluctuations/structures associated with MR exhaust and ion-ion kink mode instability during a well documented MR event Generation evolution and fading of kinklike oscillations are followed over a distance of 70 000 km from the reconnection site in the midmagnetotail to the more dipolar region near the Earth
We have developed a semi-analytic method of parameterizing N-body simulations of self-gravity wakes in Saturn&#39;s rings describing their properties by means of only 6 numbers 3 optical depths and 3 weighting factors These numbers are obtained using a density-estimation procedure that finds the frequencies of various values of local density within a simulated ring patch
<br>Application of our parameterization to a suite of N-body simulations implies that the distribution of local optical depths is trimodal rather than bimodal as previous authors have assumed Rings dominated by self-gravity wakes appear to be mostly empty space <br>The implications of this result for the analysis of occultation data are more conceptual than practical
The only adjustment needed is that the model parameter $\tau_{gap}$ should be interpreted as representing the area-weighted average optical depth within the gaps (or inter-wake regions) <br>The most significant consequence of our results applies to the question of why &#34;propeller&#34; structures observed in the mid-A ring are seen as relative-bright features
even though the most prominent features of simulated propellers are regions of relatively low density We find preliminary quantitative support for the hypothesis that propellers would be bright if they involve a local and temporary disruption of self-gravity wakes flooding the region with more &#34;photometrically active&#34; material (i e material that can contribute to the rings&#39; local optical depth) even though the overall density is lower
We follow Paper I with predictions of how gas leaking through the lunar surface could influence the regolith as might be observed via optical Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLPs) and related effects We touch on several processes but concentrate on low and high flow rate extremes perhaps the most likely We model explosive outgassing for the smallest gas overpressure at the regolith base that releases the regolith plug above it
This disturbance&#39;s timescale and affected area are consistent with observed TLPs; we also discuss other effects For slow flow escape through the regolith is prolonged by low diffusivity Water found recently in deep magma samples is unique among candidate volatiles capable of freezing between the regolith base and surface especially near the lunar poles
For major outgassing sites we consider the possible accumulation of water ice Over geological time ice accumulation can evolve downward through the regolith Depending on gases additional to water regolith diffusivity might be suppressed chemically blocking seepage and forcing the ice zone to expand to larger areas up to square km scales
again particularly at high latitudes We propose an empirical path forward wherein current and forthcoming technologies provide controlled sensitive probes of outgassing The optical transient/outgassing connection addressed via Earth-based remote sensing suggests imaging and/or spectroscopy but aspects of lunar outgassing might be more covert as indicated above TLPs betray some outgassing
Some of the satellites in the Solar System including the Moon appear to have been captured from heliocentric orbits at some point in their past and then have evolved to the present configurations The exact process of how this trapping occurred is unknown but the dissociation of a planetesimal binary in the gravitational field of the planet
gas drag or a massive collision seem to be the best candidates However all these mechanisms leave the satellites in elliptical orbits that need to be damped to the present almost circular ones Here we give a complete description of the secular tidal evolution of a satellite just after entering a bounding state with the planet
Over 300 extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been detected orbiting nearby stars We now hope to conduct a census of all planets around nearby stars and to characterize their atmospheres and surfaces with spectroscopy Rocky planets within their star&#39;s habitable zones have the highest priority as these have the potential to harbor life
Our science goal is to find and characterize all nearby exoplanets; this requires that we measure the mass orbit and spectroscopic signature of each one at visible and infrared wavelengths The techniques for doing this are at hand today Within the decade we could answer long-standing questions about the evolution and nature of other planetary systems
Numerical simulations of asteroid break-ups including both the fragmentation of the parent body and the gravitational interactions between the fragments have allowed us to reproduce successfully the main properties of asteroid families formed in different regimes of impact energy starting from a non-porous parent body In this paper using the same approach
we concentrate on a single regime of impact energy the so-called catastrophic threshold usually designated by Q*D which results in the escape of half of the target&#39;s mass Thanks to our recent implementation of a model of fragmentation of porous materials we can characterize Q*D for both porous and non-porous targets with a wide range of diameters
We can then analyze the potential influence of porosity on the value of Q*D and by computing the gravitational phase of the collision in the gravity regime we can characterize the collisional outcome in terms of the fragment size and ejection speed distributions which are the main outcome properties used by collisional models to study the evolutions of the different populations of small bodies
We also check the dependency of Q*D on the impact speed of the projectile In the strength regime which corresponds to target sizes below a few hundreds of meters we find that porous targets are more difficult to disrupt than non-porous ones In the gravity regime the outcome is controlled purely by gravity and porosity in the case of porous targets
We expand on the results of Nielsen et al (2008) using the null result for giant extrasolar planets around the 118 target stars from the VLT NACO H and Ks band planet search (Masciadri et al 2005) the VLT and MMT Simultaneous Differential Imaging (SDI) survey (Biller et al 2007)
and the Gemini Deep Planet Survey (Lafreniere et al 2007) to set constraints on the population of giant extrasolar planets Our analysis is extended to include the planet luminosity models of Fortney et al (2008) as well as the correlation between stellar mass and frequency of giant planets found by Johnson et al
(2007) Doubling the sample size of FGKM stars strengthens our conclusions a model for extrasolar giant planets with power-laws for mass and semi-major axis as giving by Cumming et al (2008) cannot with 95% confidence have planets beyond 65 AU compared to the value of 94 AU reported in Nielsen et al
(2008) using the models of Baraffe et al (2003) When the Johnson et al (2007) correction for stellar mass (which gives fewer Jupiter-mass companions to M stars with respect to solar-type stars) is applied however this limit moves out to 82 AU For the relatively new Fortney et al (2008) models
We present seven light curves of the exoplanet system HAT-P-3 taken as part of a transit timing program using the RISE instrument on the Liverpool Telescope The light curves are analysed using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm to update the parameters of the system The inclination is found to be i = 86
the planet-star radius ratio to be R_p/R_star = 0 1098^{+0 0010}_{-0 0012} and the stellar radius to be R_star = 0 834^{+0 018}_{-0 026} R_sun consistent with previous results but with a significant improvement in the precision Central transit times and uncertainties for each light curve are also determined and a residual permutation algorithm used as an independent check on the errors
The transit times are found to be consistent with a linear ephemeris and a new ephemeris is calculated as T_c(0) = 2454856 70118 +- 0 00018 HJD and P = 2 899738 +- 0 000007 days Model timing residuals are fitted to the measured timing residuals to place upper mass limits for a hypothetical perturbing planet as a function of the period ratio
I present a previously unpublished method for modeling multiple lens microlensing events that is based on the image centered ray shooting approach of Bennett and Rhie It has been used to model all a wide variety of binary and triple lens systems but it is designed to efficiently model high-magnification planetary microlensing events
because these are by far the most challenging events to model It is designed to be efficient enough to handle microlensing events with more than two lens masses and lens orbital motion This method uses a polar coordinate integration grid with a smaller grid spacing in the radial direction than in the angular direction
and it employs an integration scheme specifically designed to handle limb darkened sources I present tests that show that these features achieve second order accuracy for the light curves of a number of high-magnification planetary events They improve the precision of the calculations by a factor of &gt;100 compared to first order integration schemes with the same grid spacing in both directions (for a fixed number of grid points)
This method also includes a Metropolis algorithm chi^2 minimization method that allows the jump function to vary in a way that allows quick convergence to chi^2 minima Finally I introduce a global parameter space search strategy that allows a blind search of parameter space for light curve models without requiring chi^2 minimization over a large grid of fixed parameters
Instead the parameter space is explored on a grid of initial conditions for a set of chi^2 minimizations using the full parameter space While this method may be faster than methods that find the chi^2 minima over a large grid of parameters I argue that the main strength of this method is for events with the signals of multiple planets
Disks around young stars are known to evolve from optically thick gas-dominated protoplanetary disks to optically thin almost gas-free debris disks It is thought that the primordial gas is largely removed at ages of ~10 Myr but it is difficult to discern the true gas densities from gas observations This suggests using observations of dust
it has been argued that gas if present with higher densities would lead to flatter radial profiles of the dust density and surface brightness than those actually observed However here we show that these profiles are surprisingly insensitive to variation of the parameters of a central star location of the dust-producing planetesimal belt
dustiness of the disk and - most importantly - the parameters of the ambient gas This result holds for a wide range of gas densities (three orders of magnitude) for different radial distributions of the gas temperature and different gas compositions The brightness profile slopes of -3 -4 we find are the same that were theoretically found for gas-free debris disks
and they are the same as actually retrieved from observations of many debris disks Our specific results for three young (10-30 Myr old) spatially resolved edge-on debris disks (beta Pic HD 32297 and AU Mic) show that the observed radial profiles of the surface brightness do not pose any stringent constraints on the gas component of the disk
We cannot exclude that outer parts of the systems may have retained substantial amounts of primordial gas which is not evident in the gas observations (e g as much as 50 Earth masses for beta Pic) However the possibility that gas most likely secondary is only present in little to moderate amounts
We present the instrumentation the target selection method the data analysis pipeline and the preliminary results of the Thessaloniki Research for Transits project (ThReT) ThReT is a new project aiming to discover Hot Jupiter Planets orbiting Sun-like stars In order to locate the promising spots for observations on the celestial sphere
Spectral data are presented for comets 2006 VZ13 (LINEAR) 2006 K4 (NEAT) 2006 OF2 (Broughton) 2P/Encke and 93P/Lovas I obtained with the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1 5-m telescope in August 2007 Comet 2006 VZ13 is a new Oort cloud comet and shows strong lines of CN (3880 angstroms) the Swan band sequence for C_2 (4740
and 5630 angstroms) C_3 (4056 angstroms) and other faint species Lines are also identified in the spectra of the other comets Flux measurements of the CN C_2 (Delta v = +1 0) and C_3 lines are recorded for each comet and production rates and ratios are derived When considering the comets as a group
there is a correlation of C_2 and C_3 production with CN but there is no conclusive evidence that the production rate ratios depend on heliocentric distance The continuum is also measured and the dust production and dust-to-gas ratios are calculated There is a general trend for the group of comets
A number of synchronous moons are thought to harbor water oceans beneath their outer ice shells A subsurface ocean frictionally decouples the shell from the interior This has led to proposals that a weak tidal or atmospheric torque might cause the shell to rotate differentially with respect to the synchronously rotating interior
As a result of centrifugal and tidal forces the ocean would assume an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis aligned toward the parent planet Any displacement of the shell away from its equilibrium position would induce strains thereby increasing its elastic energy and giving rise to an elastic restoring torque
We compare the elastic torque with the tidal torque acting on Europa and the atmospheric torque acting on Titan For Europa the tidal torque is far too weak to produce stresses that could fracture the ice shell thus refuting a widely advocated idea Instead we suggest that cracks arise from time-dependent stresses due to non-hydrostatic gravity anomalies from tidally driven
episodic convection in the interior Two years of Cassini RADAR observations of Titan&#39;s surface are interpreted as implying an angular displacement of ~0 24 degrees relative to synchroneity Compatibility of the amplitude and phase of the observed non-synchronous rotation with estimates of the atmospheric torque requires that Titan&#39;s shell be decoupled from its interior
We find that the elastic torque balances the atmospheric torque at an angular displacement &lt;0 05 degrees thus coupling the shell to the interior Moreover if Titan&#39;s surface were spinning faster than synchronous the tidal torque tending to restore synchronous rotation would certainly be larger than the atmospheric torque There must either be a problem with the interpretation of the radar observations
In its all-sky survey the ESA global astrometry mission Gaia will perform high-precision astrometry and photometry for 1 billion stars down to $V = 20$ mag The data collected in the Gaia catalogue to be published by the end of the next decade will likely revolutionize our understanding of many aspects of stellar and Galactic astrophysics
One of the relevant areas in which the Gaia observations will have great impact is the astrophysics of planetary systems This summary focuses on a) the complex technical problems related to and challenges inherent in correctly modelling the signals of planetary systems present in measurements collected with a space-borne observatory poised to carry out precision astrometry at the micro-arcsecond ($\mu$as) level
The discovery of Main Belt Comets (MBCs) has raised many questions regarding the origin and activation mechanism of these objects Results of a study of the dynamics of these bodies suggest that MBCs were formed in-situ as the remnants of the break-up of large icy asteroids Simulations show that similar to the asteroids in the main belt
MBCs with orbital eccentricities smaller than 0 2 and inclinations lower than 25 degrees have stable orbits implying that many MBCs with initially larger eccentricities and inclinations might have been scattered to other regions of the asteroid belt Among scattered MBCs approximately 20 percent reach the region of terrestrial planets where they might have contributed to the accumulation of water on Earth
Simulations also show that collisions among MBCs and small objects could have played an important role in triggering the cometary activity of these bodies Such collisions might have exposed sub-surface water ice which sublimated and created thin atmospheres and tails around MBCs This paper discusses the results of numerical studies of the dynamics of MBCs and their implications for the origin of these objects
The growing rate of increase in the number of the discovered extra-solar planets which has consequently raised the enthusiasm to explore the universe in hope of finding earth-like planets has resulted in the wide use of Gravitational Microlensing as a planet detection method However until November 2009 only 9 out of the overall 405 discovered exoplanets have been detected through Microlensing
a fact which shows that this method is relatively new in the detection of extra-solar planets Therefore preparing a map of the sky which pinpoints the regions with higher probability of planet detection by this method and is drawn based on the available equipments and other regional factors would indeed
Outflows of young stars drive shocks into dusty molecular regions Most models of such shocks assume that they are steady and propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field Real shocks often violate both of these assumptions and the media through which they propagate are inhomogeneous We use the code employed previously to produce the first time-dependent simulations of fast-mode
oblique C-type shocks interacting with density perturbations We include a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation balances and a fluid treatment of grains We identify features that develop when a multifluid shock encounters a density inhomogeneity to investigate whether any part of the precursor region ever behaves in a quasi-steady fashion
If it does the shock may be modelled approximately without solving the time-dependent hydromagnetic equations Simulations were made for initially steady oblique C-type shocks encountering density inhomogeneities For a semi-finite inhomogeneity with a density larger than the surrounding medium a transmitted shock evolves from being J-type to a steady C-type shock on a timescale comparable to the ion-flow time through it
A sufficiently upstream part of the precursor of an evolving J-type shock is quasi-steady The ion-flow timescale is also relevant for the evolution of a shock moving into a region of decreasing density The models for shocks propagating into regions in which the density increases and then decreases to its initial value cannot be entirely described in terms of the results obtained for monotonically increasing and decreasing densities
In this paper we look at space weathering processes on the icy surface of Jupiter&#39;s moon Europa The heavy energetic ions of the Jovian plasma (H+ O+ S+ C+) can erode the surface of Europa via ion sputtering (IS) ejecting up to 1000 H2O molecules per ion UV Photons impinging the Europa&#39;s surface can also result in neutral atom release via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and chemical change (photolysis)
In this work we study the efficiency of the IS and PSD processes for ejecting water molecules simulating the resulting neutral H2O density We also estimate the contribution to the total neutral atom release by the Ion Backscattering (IBS) process Moreover we estimate the possibility of detecting the sputtered high energy atoms
in order to distinguish the action of the IS process from other surface release mechanisms Our main results are 1) The most significant sputtered-particle flux and the largest contribution to the neutral H2O-density come from the incident S+ ions; 2) The H2O density produced via PSD is lower than that due to sputtering by ~1
the IBS can be considered negligible for the production of neutrals whereas in the higher energy range it becomes the dominant neutral emission mechanism; 4) the total sputtering rate for Europa is 2 0\cdot 1027 H2O s-1; 5) the fraction of escaping H2O via IS is 22% of the total sputtered population
while the escape fraction for H2O produced by PSD is 30% of the total PSD population Since the PSD exosphere is lower than the IS one the major agent for Europa&#39;s surface erosion is IS on both the non-illuminated and illuminated side Lastly the exospheric neutral density estimated from the Galileo electron density measurements appears to be higher than that calculated for H2O alone; this favours the scenario of the presence of O2 produced by radiolysis and photolysis
Context Near-Earth asteroid-comet transition object 107P/ (4015) Wilson-Harrington is a possible target of the joint European Space Agency (ESA) and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Marco Polo sample return mission Physical studies of this object are relevant to this mission and also to understanding its asteroidal or cometary nature Aims
Our aim is to obtain significant new constraints on the surface thermal properties of this object Methods We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns) obtained with NASA&#39;s Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12 2007 and results from the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM)
We obtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its thermal emission Results We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta = 1 39 +/- 0 26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3 46 +/- 0 32 km and pV = 0
We also obtain similar results when we apply this best-fitting thermal model to single-band mid-IR photometry reported by Campins et al (1995) Kraemer et al (2005) and Reach et al (2007) Conclusions The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low consistent with those of comet nuclei and primitive C- P- D-type asteorids
Presolar diamond the carrier of the isotopically anomalous Xe component Xe-HL was the first mineral type of presolar dust that was isolated from meteorites The excesses in the light p-process only isotopes 124Xe and 126Xe and in the heavy r-process only isotopes 134Xe and 136Xe relative to the solar ratios indicate that Xe-HL was produced in supernovae
they are the only stellar source where these two processes are believed to take place Although these processes occur in supernovae their physical conditions and timeframes are completely different Yet the excesses are always correlated in diamond separates from meteorites Furthermore the p-process 124Xe/126Xe inferred from Xe-L and the r-process 134Xe/136Xe from Xe-H do not agree with the p-process and r-process ratios derived from the solar system abundance
and the inferred p-process ratio does not agree with those predicted from stellar models The &#39;rapid separation scenario&#39; where the separation of Xe and its radiogenic precursors Te and I takes place at the very early stage (7900 sec after the end of the r-process) has been proposed to explain Xe-H
In this outlook we describe what could be the next steps of the direct characterization of habitable exoplanets after first the medium and large mission projects and investigate the benefits of the spectroscopic and direct imaging approaches We show that after third and fourth generation missions foreseeable for the next 100 years
We study the torque on low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary discs in the two-dimensional approximation incorporating non-isothermal effects We couple linear estimates of the Lindblad (or wave) torque to a simple but non-linear model of adiabatic corotation torques (or horseshoe drag) resulting in a simple formula that governs Type I migration in non-isothermal discs
We report measurements of the thermal emission of the young and massive planet CoRoT-2b at 4 5 and 8 microns with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Our measured occultation depths are 0 510 +- 0 042 % and 0 41 +- 0 11 % at 4 5 and 8 microns
respectively In addition to the CoRoT optical measurements these planet/star flux ratios indicate a poor heat distribution to the night side of the planet and are in better agreement with an atmosphere free of temperature inversion layer Still the presence of such an inversion is not definitely ruled out by the observations and a larger wavelength coverage is required to remove the current ambiguity
Our global analysis of CoRoT Spitzer and ground-based data confirms the large mass and size of the planet with slightly revised values (Mp = 3 47 +- 0 22 Mjup Rp = 1 466 +- 0 044 Rjup) We find a small but significant offset in the timing of the occultation when compared to a purely circular orbital solution
leading to e cos(omega) = -0 00291 +- 0 00063 where e is the orbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of periastron Constraining the age of the system to be at most of a few hundreds of Myr and assuming that the non-zero orbital eccentricity is not due to a third undetected body
we model the coupled orbital-tidal evolution of the system with various tidal Q values core sizes and initial orbital parameters For log(Q_s&#39;) = 5 - 6 our modelling is able to explain the large radius of CoRoT-2b if log(Q_p&#39;) &lt;= 5 5 through a transient tidal circularization and corresponding planet tidal heating event
We present a new analysis of the Jupiter+Saturn analog system OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb c which was the first double planet system discovered with the gravitational microlensing method This is the only multi-planet system discovered by any method with measured masses for the star and both planets In addition to the signatures of two planets
this event also exhibits a microlensing parallax signature and finite source effects that provide a direct measure of the masses of the star and planets and the expected brightness of the host star is confirmed by Keck AO imaging yielding masses of M_* = 0 51(+0 05-0 04) M_sun M_b = 231+-19 M_earth
M_c = 86+-7 M_earth The Saturn-analog planet in this system had a planetary light curve deviation that lasted for 11 days and as a result the effects of the orbital motion are visible in the microlensing light curve We find that four of the six orbital parameters are tightly constrained and that a fifth parameter
the orbital acceleration is weakly constrained No orbital information is available for the Jupiter-analog planet but its presence helps to constrain the orbital motion of the Saturn-analog planet Assuming co-planar orbits we find an orbital eccentricity of eccentricity = 0 15 (+0 17-0 10) and an orbital inclination of i = 64 (+4-7) deg
Giant planet formation process is still not completely understood The current most accepted paradigm the core instability model explains several observed properties of the solar system&#39;s giant planets but to date has faced difficulties to account for a formation time shorter than the observational estimates of protoplanetary disks&#39; lifetimes especially for the cases of Uranus and Neptune
In the context of this model and considering a recently proposed primordial solar system orbital structure we performed numerical calculations of giant planet formation Our results show that if accreted planetesimals follow a size distribution in which most of the mass lies in 30-100 meter sized bodies Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune may have formed according to the nucleated instability scenario
We present a simplified model to study the orbital evolution of a young hot Jupiter inside the magnetospheric cavity of a proto-planetary disk The model takes into account the disk locking of stellar spin as well as the tidal and magnetic interactions between the star and the planet We focus on the orbital evolution starting from the orbit in the 2
followed by the inward and then outward orbital migration driven by the tidal and magnetic torques as well as the Roche-lobe overflow of the tidally inflated planet The goal in this paper is to study how the orbital evolution inside the magnetospheric cavity depends on the cavity size planet mass
and orbital eccentricity In the present work we only target the mass range from 0 7 to 2 Jupiter masses In the case of the large cavity corresponding to the rotational period ~ 7 days the planet of mass &gt;1 Jupiter mass with moderate initial eccentricities (&gt;~ 0 3) can move to the region &lt; 0
while the planet of mass &lt;1 Jupiter mass cannot We estimate the critical eccentricity beyond which the planet of a given mass will overflow its Roche radius and finally lose all of its gas onto the star due to runaway mass loss In the case of the small cavity corresponding to the rotational period ~ 3 days
The core accretion theory of planet formation has at least two fundamental problems explaining the origins of Uranus and Neptune (1) dynamical times in the trans-Saturnian solar nebula are so long that core growth can take &gt; 15 Myr and (2) the onset of runaway gas accretion that begins when cores reach 10 Earth masses necessitates a sudden gas accretion cutoff just as the ice giant cores reach critical mass
Both problems may be resolved by allowing the ice giants to migrate outward after their formation in solid-rich feeding zones with planetesimal surface densities well above the minimum-mass solar nebula We present new simulations of the formation of Uranus and Neptune in the solid-rich disk of Dodson-Robinson et al (2009) using the initial semimajor axis distribution of the Nice model (Gomes et al
with one ice giant forming at 12 AU and the other at 15 AU The innermost ice giant reaches its present mass after 3 8-4 0 Myr and the outermost after 5 3-6 Myr a considerable time decrease from previous one-dimensional simulations (e g Pollack et al 1996) The core masses stay subcritical
eliminating the need for a sudden gas accretion cutoff Our calculated carbon mass fractions of 22% are in excellent agreement with the ice giant interior models of Podolak et al (1995) and Marley et al (1995) Based on the requirement that the ice giant-forming planetesimals contain &gt;10% mass fractions of methane ice
Constructing dynamical maps from the filtered output of numerical integrations we analyze the structure of the $\nu_\odot$ secular resonance for fictitious irregular satellites in retrograde orbits This commensurability is associated to the secular angle $\theta = \varpi - \varpi_\odot$ where $\varpi$ is the longitude of pericenter of the satellite and $\varpi_\odot$ corresponds to the (fixed) planetocentric orbit of the Sun
Our study is performed in the restricted three-body problem where the satellites are considered as massless particles around a massive planet and perturbed by the Sun Depending on the initial conditions the resonance presents a diversity of possible resonant modes including librations of $\theta$ around zero (as found for Sinope and Pasiphae) or 180 degrees
as well as asymmetric librations (e g Narvi) Symmetric modes are present in all giant planets although each regime appears restricted to certain values of the satellite inclination Asymmetric solutions on the other hand seem absent around Neptune due to its almost circular heliocentric orbit Simulating the effects of a smooth orbital migration on the satellite
we find that the resonance lock is preserved as long as the induced change in semimajor axis is much slower compared to the period of the resonant angle (adiabatic limit) However the librational mode may vary during the process switching between symmetric and asymmetric oscillations Finally we present a simple scaling transformation that allows to estimate the resonant structure around any giant planet from the results calculated around a single primary mass
For more than 140 years the chemical composition of our Sun has been considered typical of solar-type stars Our highly differential elemental abundance analysis of unprecedented accuracy (~0 01 dex) of the Sun relative to solar twins shows that the Sun has a peculiar chemical composition with a ~20% depletion of refractory elements relative to the volatile elements in comparison with solar twins
The abundance differences correlate strongly with the condensation temperatures of the elements A similar study of solar analogs from planet surveys shows that this peculiarity also holds in comparisons with solar analogs known to have close-in giant planets while the majority of solar analogs without detected giant planets show the solar abundance pattern
Transiting planet discoveries have yielded a plethora of information regarding the internal structure and atmospheres of extra-solar planets These discoveries have been restricted to the low-periastron distance regime due to the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability Monitoring known radial velocity planets at predicted transit times is a proven method of detecting transits
and presents an avenue through which to explore the mass-radius relationship of exoplanets in new regions of period/periastron space Here we describe transit window calculations for known radial velocity planets techniques for refining their transit ephemerides target selection criteria and observational methods for obtaining maximum coverage of transit windows These methods are currently being implemented by the Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS)
Comet 133P/Elst-Pizarro is the first-known and currently best-characterised member of the main-belt comets a recently-identified class of objects that exhibit cometary activity but which are dynamically indistinguishable from main-belt asteroids We report here on the results of a multi-year monitoring campaign from 2003 to 2008 and present observations of the return of activity in 2007
We find a pattern of activity consistent with the seasonal activity modulation hypothesis proposed by Hsieh et al (2004 AJ 127 2997) Additionally recomputation of phase function parameters using data in which 133P was inactive yields new IAU parameters of H_R=15 49+/-0 05 mag and G_R=0 04+/-0 05 and linear parameters of m_R(1
Comparison between predicted magnitudes using these new parameters and the comet&#39;s actual brightnesses during its 2002 and 2007 active periods reveals the presence of unresolved coma during both episodes on the order of ~0 20 of the nucleus cross-section in 2002 and ~0 25 in 2007 Multifilter observations during 133P&#39;s 2007 active outburst yield mean nucleus colours of B-V=0
V-R=0 36+/-0 01 mag and R-I=0 32+/-0 01 mag with no indication of significant rotational variation and similar colours for the trail Finally while 133P&#39;s trail appears shorter and weaker in 2007 than in 2002 other measures of activity strength such as dust velocity and coma contamination of nucleus photometry are found to remain approximately constant
The snow line in a gas disk is defined as the distance from the star beyond which the water ice is stable against evaporation Since oxygen is the most abundant element after hydrogen and helium the presence of ice grains can have important consequences for disk evolution However determining the position of the snow line is not simple
We investigate the dynamical evolution of a Jovian--mass planet injected into an orbit highly inclined with respect to its nesting gaseous disk Planet--planet scattering induced by convergent planetary migration and mean motion resonances may push a planet into such an out of plane configuration with inclinations as large as $20^\circ-30^\circ$
In this scenario the tidal interaction of the planet with the disk is more complex and in addition to the usual Lindblad and corotation resonances it involves also inclination resonances responsible of bending waves <br>We have performed three--dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the disk and of its interactions with the planet with a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code
A main result is that the initial large eccentricity and inclination of the planetary orbit are rapidly damped on a timescale of the order of $10^3$ yrs almost independently of the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of the planet The disk is warped in response to the planet perturbations and it precesses
Inward migration occurs also when the planet is inclined and it has a drift rate which is intermediate between type I and type II migration The planet is not able to open a gap until its inclination becomes lower than $\sim 10^\circ$ when it also begins to accrete a significant amount of mass from the disk
Since planets were first discovered outside our own Solar System in 1992 (around a pulsar) and in 1995 (around a main sequence star) extrasolar planet studies have become one of the most dynamic research fields in astronomy Now that more than 370 exoplanets have been discovered focus has moved from finding planets to characterise these alien worlds
As well as detecting the atmospheres of these exoplanets part of the characterisation process undoubtedly involves the search for extrasolar moons A review on the current situation of exoplanet characterization is presented in Chapter 3 We focus on the characterization of transiting planets orbiting very close to their parent star since for them we can already probe their atmospheric constituents
By contrast the second part of the Chapter is dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life both within and beyond the Solar System The characteristics of the Habitable Zone and the markers for the presence of life (biosignatures) are detailed In Chapter 4 we describe the primary transit observations of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b we obtained at 3
Chapter 5 is dedicated to the search for exomoons we review a model for the TTV and TDV signals which permits not only the identification of exomoons but also the derivation of some of their characteristics Finally in Chapter 6 the detectability of a habitable-zone exomoon around various configurations of exoplanetary systems with the Kepler Mission or photometry of approximately equal quality is investigated
The search for life outside of the Solar System should not be restricted to exclusively planetary bodies; large moons of extrasolar planets may also be common habitable environments throughout the Galaxy Extrasolar moons or exomoons may be detected through transit timing effects induced onto the host planet as a result of mutual gravitational interaction
In particular transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) are predicted to produce a unique exomoon signature which is not only easily distinguished from other gravitational perturbations but also provides both the period and mass of an exomoon Using these timing effects photometry greater or equal to that of the Kepler Mission is readily able to detect habitable-zone exomoons down to 0
We use the Spitzer Space Telescope to estimate the dayside thermal emission of the exoplanet TrES-3 integrated in the 3 6 4 5 5 8 and 8 0 micron bandpasses of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) instrument We observe two secondary eclipses and find relative eclipse depths of 0 00346 +/- 0
and 0 00475 +/- 0 00046 respectively in the 4 IRAC bandpasses We combine our results with the earlier K band measurement of De Mooij et al (2009) and compare them with models of the planetary emission We find that the planet does not require the presence of an inversion layer in the high atmosphere
This is the first very strongly irradiated planet that does not have a temperature inversion which indicates that stellar or planetary characteristics other than temperature have an important impact on temperature inversion De Mooij &amp; Snellen (2009) also detected a possible slight offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse in K band
We compare the results of the numerical simulation of the viscous-like interaction of the solar wind with the plasma tail of a comet with velocities of H2O+ ions in the tail of comet Swift-Tuttle determined by means of spectroscopic ground based observations Our aim is to constrain the value of the basic parameters in the viscous-like interaction model
the effective Reynolds number of the flow and the interspecies coupling timescale We find that in our simulations the flow rapidly evolves from an arbitrary initial condition to a quasi-steady state for which there is a good agreement between the simulated tailward velocity of H2O+ ions and the kinematics derived from the observations
The fiducial case of our model characterized by a low effective Reynolds number (Re \approx 20 and selected on the basis of a comparison to in situ measurements of the plasma flow at comet Halley yields an excellent fit to the observed kinematics Given the agreement between model and observations
The determination of Saturn&#39;s atmospheric noble gas abundances are critical to understanding the formation and evolution of Saturn and giant planets in general These measurements can only be performed with an entry probe A Saturn probe will address whether enhancement in heavy noble gases as was found in Jupiter are a general feature of giant planets
and their ratios will be a powerful constraint on how they form The helium abundance will show the extent to which helium has phase separated from hydrogen in the planet&#39;s deep interior Jupiter&#39;s striking neon depletion may also be tied to its helium depletion and must be confirmed or refuted in Saturn
Together with Jupiter&#39;s measured atmospheric helium abundance a consistent evolutionary theory for both planets including &#34;helium rain&#34; will be possible We will then be able to calibrate the theory of the evolution of all giant planets including exoplanets In addition high pressure H/He mixtures under giant planet conditions are an important area of condensed matter physics that are beyond the realm of experiment
Comet 17P/Holmes was observed for linear polarisation using the optical polarimeter mounted on the 1 2m telescope atop Gurushikhar peak near Mt Abu during the period November-December 2007 Observations were conducted through the IHW narrow band (continuum) filters During the observing run the phase angle was near $13^{\circ}$ at which the comet showed negative polarisation
On the basis of the observed polarisation data we find comet 17P/Holmes to be a typical comet with usual dust characteristics We note that radial rate of change of brightness in coma in red band is higher than that in blue band; it has decreased by a factor of 3
indicating relative increase in the abundance of smaller dust particles out ward Radial brightness variation seen near the nucleus on November 6 is indicative of the presence of a blob or shocked region beyond 10&#34; from the nucleus which has gradually smoothened by December 13 The brightness distribution is found steeper during November 5-7 as compared to on December 13
Aims Caustic-crossing binary-lens microlensing events are important anomalous events because they are capable of detecting an extrasolar planet companion orbiting the lens star Fast and robust modelling methods are thus of prime interest in helping to decide whether a planet is detected by an event Cassan (2008) introduced a new set of parameters to model binary-lens events
which are closely related to properties of the light curve In this work we explain how Bayesian priors can be added to this framework and investigate on interesting options Methods We develop a mathematical formulation that allows us to compute analytically the priors on the new parameters given some previous knowledge about other physical quantities
We explicitly compute the priors for a number of interesting cases and show how this can be implemented in a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm Results Using Bayesian priors can accelerate microlens fitting codes by reducing the time spent considering physically implausible models and helps us to discriminate between alternative models based on the physical plausibility of their parameters
Knowledge about the age of presolar grains provides important insights into Galactic chemical evolution and the dynamics of grain formation and destruction processes in the Galaxy Determination from the abundance of cosmic ray interaction products is straightforward but in the past has suffered from uncertainties in correcting for recoil losses of spallation products
The problem is less serious in a class of large (tens of micrometer) grains We describe the correction procedure and summarise results for He and Ne ages of presolar SiC &#34;Jumbo&#34; grains that range from close to zero to ~850 Myr with the majority being less than 200 Myr We also discuss the possibility of extending our approach to the majority of smaller SiC grains and explore possible contributions from trapping of cosmic rays
Proper characterization of the host star to a planet is a key element to the understanding of its overall properties The star has a direct impact through the modification of the structure and evolution of the planet atmosphere by being the overwhelmingly larger source of energy The star plays a central role in shaping the structure
evolution and even determining the mere existence of planetary atmospheres The vast majority of the stellar flux is well understood thanks to the impressive progress made in the modeling of stellar atmospheres At short wavelengths (X-rays to UV) however the information is scarcer since the stellar emission does not originate in the photosphere but in the chromospheric and coronal regions
which are much less understood The same can be said about particle emissions with a strong impact on planetary atmospheres because a detailed description of the time-evolution of stellar wind is still lacking Here we review our current understanding of the flux and particle emissions of the Sun and low-mass stars and briefly address their impact in the context of planetary atmospheres
Model Production Function chronology uses dynamic models of the Main Belt Asteroids (MBAs) and Near Earth Objects (NEOs) to derive the impactor flux to a target body This is converted into the crater size-frequency-distribution for a specific planetary surface and calibrated using the radiometric ages of different regions of the Moon&#39;s surface
This new approach has been applied to the crater counts on Mariner 10 images of the highlands and of several large impact basins on Mercury MPF estimates for the plains show younger ages than those of previous chronologies Assuming a variable uppermost layering of the Hermean crust the age of the Caloris interior plains may be as young as 3
Characterizing the surfaces of rocky exoplanets via the scattered light will be an essential challenge to investigate the existence of life on habitable exoplanets We present a simple reconstruction method for fractional areas of different surface types from photometric variations or colors of a second Earth We create mock light curves for Earth without clouds using empirical data
Then these light curves are fitted to the isotropic scattering model consisting of 4 surface types ocean soil snow and vegetation In an idealized situation where the photometric errors are only photon shot noise we are able to reproduce the fractional areas of those components fairly well We may be even able to detect a signature of vegetation from the distinct feature of photosynthesis on the Earth
Neptune Trojans and Plutinos are two subpopulations of trans-Neptunian objects located in the 1 1 and the 3 2 mean motion resonances with Neptune respectively and therefore protected from close encounters with the planet However the orbits of these two kinds of objects may cross very often allowing a higher collisional rate between them than with other kinds of trans-Neptunian objects
and a consequent size distribution modification of the two subpopulations <br>Observational colors and absolute magnitudes of Neptune Trojans and Plutinos show that i) there are no intrinsically bright (large) Plutinos at small inclinations ii) there is an apparent excess of blue and intrinsically faint (small) Plutinos and iii) Neptune Trojans possess the same blue colors as Plutinos within the same (estimated) size range do
<br>For the present subpopulations we analyzed the most favorable conditions for close encounters/collisions and address any link there could be between those encounters and the sizes and/or colors of Plutinos and Neptune Trojans We also performed a simultaneous numerical simulation of the outer Solar System over 1 Gyr for all these bodies in order to estimate their collisional rate
<br>We conclude that orbital overlap between Neptune Trojans and Plutinos is favored for Plutinos with large libration amplitudes high eccentricities and small inclinations Additionally with the assumption that the collisions can be disruptive creating smaller objects not necessarily with similar colors the present high concentration of small Plutinos with small inclinations can thus be a consequence of a collisional interaction with Neptune Trojans and such hypothesis should be further analyzed
We present a pre-discovery H-band image of the HR 8799 planetary system that reveals all three planets in August 2007 The data were obtained with the Keck adaptive optics system using angular differential imaging and a coronagraph We confirm the physical association of all three planets including HR 8799d which had only been detected in 2008 images taken two months apart
and whose association with HR 8799 was least secure until now We confirm that the planets are 2-3 mag fainter than field brown dwarfs of comparable near-infrared colors We note that similar under-luminosity is characteristic of young substellar objects at the L/T spectral type transition and is likely due to enhanced dust content and non-equilibrium CO/CH_4 chemistry in their atmospheres
Finally we place an upper limit of 18 mag per square arc second on the &gt;120 AU H-band dust-scattered light from the HR 8799 debris disk The upper limit on the integrated scattered light flux is 1e-4 times the photospheric level 24 times fainter than the debris ring around HR 4796A
In recent years we have been witnessing the discovery of one extrasolar gas giant after another Now the time has come to detect more low-mass planets like Super-Earths and Earth-like objects An interesting question to ask is where should we look for them? We have explored here the possibility of finding Super-Earths in the close vicinity of gas giants
as a result of the early evolution of planetary systems For this purpose we have considered a young planetary system containing a Super-Earth and a gas giant both embedded in a protoplanetary disc We have shown that if the Super-Earth is on the internal orbit relative to the gas giant
the planets can easily become locked in a mean motion resonance This is no longer true however if the Super-Earth is on the external orbit In this case we have obtained that the low-mass planet is captured in a trap at the outer edge of the gap opened by the giant planet and no first order mean motion commensurabilities are expected
Recent observations of exoplanets by direct imaging reveal that giant planets orbit at a few dozens to more than a hundred of AU from their central star The question of the origin of these planets challenges the standard theories of planet formation We propose a new way of obtaining such far planets
by outward migration of a pair of planets formed in the 10 AU region Two giant planets in mean motion resonance in a common gap in the protoplanetary disk migrate outwards if the inner one is significantly more massive than the outer one Using hydrodynamical simulations we show that their semi major axes can increase by almost one order of magnitude
We report the detection in Ks-band of the secondary eclipse of the hot Jupiter CoRoT-1b from time series photometry with the ARC 3 5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory The eclipse shows a depth of 0 336+/-0 042 percent and is centered at phase 0 5022 (+0 0023 -0 0027)
consistent with a zero eccentricity orbit ecos{\omega} = 0 0035 (+0 0036 -0 0042) We perform the first optical to near-infrared multi-band photometric analysis of an exoplanet&#39;s atmosphere and constrain the reflected and thermal emissions by combining our result with the recent 0 6 0 71 and 2 09 micron secondary eclipse detections by Snellen et al
(2009) Gillon et al (2009) and Alonso et al (2009a) Comparing the multi-wavelength detections to state-of-the-art radiative-convective chemical-equilibrium atmosphere models we find the near-infrared fluxes difficult to reproduce The closest blackbody-based and physical models provide the following atmosphere parameters a temperature T = 2454 (+84 -170) K a very low Bond albedo A_B = 0
-0 000) and an energy redistribution parameter P_n = 0 1 indicating a small but nonzero amount of heat transfer from the day- to night-side The best physical model suggests a thermal inversion layer with an extra optical absorber of opacity kappa_e =0 05cm^2g^-1 placed near the 0 1-bar atmospheric pressure level
We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy We run millions of 1D atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space and present error contours in the atmospheric properties given the data In order to run such a large number of models
we have developed a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets HD 189733b and HD 209458b which have the best available Spitzer and HST observations
For HD 189733b we find efficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H2O CO CH4 and CO2 For HD 209458b we confirm and constrain the day-side thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile We also report independent detections of H$_2$O
CO CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on the dayside of HD 209458b based on six-channel Spitzer photometry We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths Moreover a noticeably strong carbon dioxide absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another
Radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres is usually treated in the static limit i e neglecting atmospheric motions We argue that hot Jupiter atmospheres with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds may require a more strongly coupled treatment formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics To lowest order in v/c relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along optical paths with finite wind velocity gradients
This leads to flow-dependent deviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the atmospheric medium Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the radiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial We present transmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which suggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter atmospheres
If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for the global radiative balance accurate modeling and reliable data interpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging it would involve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled radiation-hydrodynamical flow On the bright side it would also imply that the emergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their atmospheric flows than is the case for Solar System planets
The Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) is a set of mission concepts for the next generation UV-Optical-Near Infrared space telescope with an aperture size of 8 to 16 meters ATLAST using an internal coronagraph or an external occulter can characterize the atmosphere and surface of an Earth-sized exoplanet in the Habitable Zone of long-lived stars at distances up to ~45 pc
including its rotation rate climate and habitability ATLAST will also allow us to glean information on the nature of the dominant surface features changes in cloud cover and climate and potentially seasonal variations in surface vegetation ATLAST will be able to visit up to 200 stars in 5 years at least three times each
We present a detailed survey of the dynamical structure of the phase space around the new moons of the Pluto - Charon system The spatial elliptic restricted three-body problem was used as model and stability maps were created by chaos indicators The orbital elements of the moons are in the stable domain both on the semimajor axis - eccentricity and - inclination spaces
The structures related to the 4 1 and 6 1 mean motion resonances are clearly visible on the maps They do not contain the positions of the moons confirming previous studies We showed the possibility that Nix might be in the 4 1 resonance if its argument of pericenter or longitude of node falls in a certain range
[abridged] We attempt to improve on the characterization of the properties (orbital elements masses) of two Doppler-detected sub-stellar companions to the nearby G dwarfs HD 131664 and HD 43848 We carry out orbital fits to the Hipparcos IAD for the two stars taking advantage of the knowledge of the spectroscopic orbits
and solving for the two orbital elements that can be determined in principle solely by astrometry the inclination angle $i$ and the longitude of the ascending node $\Omega$ A number of checks are carried out in order to assess the reliability of the orbital solutions thus obtained The best-fit solution for HD 131664 yields $i=55\pm33$ deg and $\Omega=22\pm28$ deg
The resulting inferred true companion mass is then $M_c = 23_{-5}^{+26}$ $M_J$ For \object{HD 43848} we find $i=12\pm7$ deg and $\Omega=288\pm22$ deg and $M_c = 120_{-43}^{+167}$ $M_J$ Based on the statistical evidence from an $F$-test the study of the joint confidence intervals of variation of $i$ and $\Omega$ and the comparison of the derived orbital semi-major axes with a distribution of false astrometric orbits obtained for single stars observed by Hipparcos
the astrometric signal of the two companions to HD 131664 and HD 43848 is then considered detected in the Hipparcos IAD with a level of statistical confidence not exceeding 95% We constrain the true mass of HD 131664b to that of a brown dwarf to within a somewhat statistically significant degree of confidence ($\sim2-\sigma$)
We present the results of the two most recent (2005) XMM-Newton observations of Saturn together with the re-analysis of an earlier (2002) observation from the XMM-Newton archive and of three Chandra observations in 2003 and 2004 While the XMM-Newton telescope resolution does not enable us to resolve spatially the contributions of the planet&#39;s disk and rings to the X-ray flux
we can estimate their strengths and their evolution over the years from spectral analysis and compare them with those observed with Chandra The spectrum of the X-ray emission is well fitted by an optically thin coronal model with an average temperature of 0 5 keV The addition of a fluorescent oxygen emission line at ~0
In accordance with earlier reports we interpret the coronal component as emission from the planetary disk produced by the scattering of solar X-rays in Saturn&#39;s upper atmosphere and the line as originating from the Saturnian rings The strength of the disk X-ray emission is seen to decrease over the period 2002 - 2005
following the decay of solar activity towards the current minimum in the solar cycle By comparing the relative fluxes of the disk X-ray emission and the oxygen line we suggest that the line strength does not vary over the years in the same fashion as the disk flux We consider possible alternatives for the origin of the line
The connection between solar activity and the strength of Saturn&#39;s disk X-ray emission is investigated and compared with that of Jupiter We also discuss the apparent lack of X-ray aurorae on Saturn and conclude that they are likely to lie below the sensitivity threshold of current Earth-bound observatories A similar comparison for Uranus and Neptune leads to the same disappointing conclusion
The terrestrial and gas-giant planets in our solar system may represent some prototypes for planets around other stars; the exoplanets because most stars have similar overall elemental abundances as our sun The solar system planets represent at least four chemical planet types depending on the phases that make them Terrestrial-like planets made of rock (metal plus silicates)
Plutonian planets made of rock and ice Neptunian giant planets of rocky icy with low H and He contents and Jovian gas-giant planets of rocky icy planets with near-solar H and He contents The planetary compositions are linked to the chemical fractionation in the planetary accretion disks Chemical tracers of these fractionations are described
Many known exoplanets are gas-giant planets with up to several Jupiter-masses and their atmospheric chemistry is compared to that of brown dwarfs Exoplanets in close orbits around their host stars may resemble hot brown dwarfs (L-dwarfs) Planets receiving less radiation form their host may compare more to the methane-rich T dwarfs
Direct measurements of the spectra of extrasolar giant planets are the keys to determining their physical and chemical nature The goal of theory is to provide the tools and context with which such data are understood It is only by putting spectral observations through the sieve of theory that the promise of exoplanet research can be realized
With the new {\em Spitzer} and HST data of transiting &#34;hot Jupiters &#34; we have now dramatically entered the era of remote sensing We are probing their atmospheric compositions and temperature profiles are constraining their atmospheric dynamics and are investigating their phase light curves Soon many non-transiting exoplanets with wide separations (analogs of Jupiter) will be imaged and their light curves and spectra measured
We present precision radial velocity data that reveal a Super-Earth mass planet and two probable additional planets orbiting the bright nearby G0V star HD 1461 Our 12 8 years of Keck HIRES precision radial velocities indicate the presence of a 7 4M_Earth planet on a 5 77-day orbit The data also suggest
but cannot yet confirm the presence of outer planets on low-eccentricity orbits with periods of 446 1 and 5017 days and projected masses (M sin i) of 27 9 and 87 1M_Earth respectively Test integrations of systems consistent with the radial velocity data suggest that the configuration is dynamically stable
We present a 12 2-year time series of photometric observations of HD 1461 which comprise 799 individual measurements and indicate that it has excellent long-term photometric stability However there are small amplitude variations with periods comparable to those of the suspected 2nd and 3rd signals in the radial velocities near 5000 and 446 days
thus casting some suspicion on those periodicities as Keplerian signals If the 5 77-day companion has a Neptune-like composition then its expected transit depth is of order ~0 5 millimags The geometric a priori probability of transits is ~8% Phase-folding of the ground-based photometry shows no indication that transits of the 5
but high-precision follow-up of HD 1461 during upcoming transit phase windows will be required to definitively rule out or confirm transits This new system joins a growing list of solar-type stars in the immediate galactic neighborhood that are accompanied by at least one Neptune- (or lower) mass planets having orbital periods of 50 days or less
Oxygen (O) and carbon (C) have been inferred recently to be subsolar in abundance from spectra of the atmosphere of the transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b Yet the mass and radius of the planet coupled with structure models indicate a strongly supersolar abundance of heavy elements in the interior of this object
Here we explore the discrepancy between the large amount of heavy elements suspected in the planet&#39;s interior and the paucity of volatiles measured in its atmosphere We describe the formation sequence of the icy planetesimals formed beyond the snow line of the protoplanetary disk and calculate the composition of ices ultimately accreted in the envelope of HD 189733b on its migration pathway
This allows us to reproduce the observed volatile abundances by adjusting the mass of ices vaporized in the envelope The predicted elemental mixing ratios should be 0 15--0 3 times solar in the envelope of HD 189733b if they are fitted to the recent O and C determinations However our fit to the minimum mass of heavy elements predicted by internal structure models gives elemental abundances that are 1
We propose that the most likely cause of this discrepancy is irradiation from the central star leading to development of a radiative zone in the planet&#39;s outer envelope which would induce gravitational settling of elements Hence all strongly irradiated extrasolar planets should present subsolar abundances of volatiles We finally predict that the abundances of nitrogen (N)
Transiting exoplanets provide unparalleled access to the fundamental parameters of both extrasolar planets and their host stars We present limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) for the exoplanet hunting CoRot and Kepler missions The LDCs are calculated with ATLAS stellar atmospheric model grids and span a wide range of Teff log g and metallically [M/H]
Both CoRot and Kepler contain wide nonstandard response functions and are producing a large inventory of high-quality transiting lightcurves sensitive to stellar limb darkening Comparing the stellar model limb darkening to results from the first seven CoRot planets we find better fits are found when two model intensities at the limb are excluded in the coefficient calculations
A second large programme (LP) for the physical studies of TNOs and Centaurs started at ESO Cerro Paranal on October 2006 to obtain high-quality data has recently been concluded In this paper we present the spectra of these pristine bodies obtained in the visible range during the last two semesters of the LP
We investigate the spectral behaviour of the TNOs and Centaurs observed and we analyse the spectral slopes distribution of the full data set coming from this LP and from the literature We computed the spectral slope for each observed object and searched for possible weak absorption features A statistical analysis was performed on a total sample of 73 TNOs and Centaurs to look for possible correlations between dynamical classes
orbital parameters and spectral gradient We obtained new spectra for 28 bodies 15 of which were observed for the first time All the new presented spectra are featureless including 2003 AZ84 for which a faint and broad absorption band possibly attributed to hydrated silicates on its surface has been reported
The data confirm a wide variety of spectral behaviours with neutral--grey to very red gradients An analysis of the spectral slopes available from this LP and in the literature for a total sample of 73 Centaurs and TNOs shows that there is a lack of very red objects in the classical population
We present the results of the statistical analysis of the spectral slope distribution versus orbital parameters In particular we confirm a strong anticorrelation between spectral slope and orbital inclination for the classical population A strong correlation is also found between the spectral slope and orbital eccentricity for resonant TNOs with objects having higher spectral slope values with increasing eccentricity
The Kuiper belt object Orcus and its satellite Vanth form an unusual system in the Kuiper belt Orcus is amongst the largest objects known in the Kuiper belt but the relative size of Vanth is much larger than that of the tiny satellites of the other large objects From Hubble Space Telescope observations we find that Orcus and Vanth have different visible colors and that Vanth does not share the water ice absorption feature seen in the infrared spectrum of Orcus
We also find that Vanth has a nearly face-on circular orbit with a period of 9 5393 +-0 0001 days and semimajor axis of 8980+-20 km implying a system mass of 6 32+- 0 01 X 10^20 kg or 3 8% the mass of dwarf planet Eris <br>From Spitzer Space Telescope observations we find that the thermal emission is consistent with a single body with diameter 940+-70 km and a geometric albedo of 0
Assuming equal densities and albedos this measurements implies sizes of Orcus and Vanth of 900 and 280 km respectively and a mass ratio of 33 Assuming a factor of 2 lower albedo for the non-icy Vanth however implies sizes of 820 and 640 km and a mass ratio of 2
The measured density depends on the assumed albedo ratio of the two objects but is approximately 1 5+-0 3 g cm^-3$ midway between typical densities measured for larger and for smaller objects The orbit and mass ratio is consistent with formation from a giant impact and subsequent outward tidal evolution and even consistent with the system having now achieved a double synchronous state
We present a pre-survey study of using Pan-STARRS high sampling rate video mode guide star images to search for TNOs With suitable selection of the guide stars within the Pan-STARRS 7 deg^{2} field of view the lightcurves of these guide stars can also be used to search for occultations by TNOs
The best target stars for this purpose are stars with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small angular <a href="http //size In" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> order to do this we compiled a catalog using the SNR calculated from stars with m_V &lt;13 mag in the Tycho2 catalog then cross matched these stars with the 2MASS catalog and estimated their angular sizes from (V-K) color
We also outlined a new detection method based on matched filter that is optimized to search for diffraction patterns in the lightcurves due to occultation by sub-kilometer TNOs A detection threshold is set to compromise between real detections and false positives Depending on the theoretical size distribution model used we expect to find up to a hundred events during the three-year life time of the Pan-STARRS-1 project
We have tested the detection algorithm and the pipeline on a set of engineering data (taken at 10Hz in stead of 30Hz) No events were found within the engineering data which is consistent with the small size of the data set and the theoretical models Meanwhile with a total of ~ 22 star-hours video mode data (|\beta| &lt; 10^{\circ})
We present a transport model that describes the orbital diffusion of asteroids in chaotic regions of the 3-D space of proper elements Our goal is to use a simple random-walk model to study the evolution and derive accurate age estimates for dynamically complex asteroid families To this purpose we first compute local diffusion coefficients
which characterize chaotic diffusion in proper eccentricity (e_p) and inclination (I_p) in a selected phase-space region Then a Monte-Carlo-type code is constructed and used to track the evolution of random walkers (i e asteroids) by coupling diffusion in (e_p I_p) with a drift in proper semi-major axis (a_p) induced by the Yarkovsky/YORP thermal effects
We validate our model by applying it to the family of (490) Veritas for which we recover previous estimates of its age (~8 3 Myr) Moreover we show that the spreading of chaotic family members in proper elements space is well reproduced in our random-walk simulations Finally we apply our model to the family of (3556) Lixiaohua
The ever increasing level of precision achieved by present and future radial-velocity instruments is opening the way to discovering very low-mass long-period planets (e g solar-system analogs) These systems will be detectable as low-amplitude signals in radial-velocity (RV) However an important obstacle to their detection may be the existence of stellar magnetic cycles on similar timescales
Here we present the results of a long-term program to simultaneously measure radial-velocities and stellar-activity indicators (CaII H_alpha HeI) for a sample of stars with known activity cycles Our results suggest that all these stellar activity indexes can be used to trace the stellar magnetic cycle in solar-type stars Likewise
we find clear indications that different parameters of the HARPS cross-correlation function (BIS FWHM and contrast) are also sensitive to activity level variations Finally we show that although in a few cases slight correlations or anti-correlations between radial-velocity and the activity level of the star exist their origin is still not clear
Many multi-planet systems have been discovered in recent years Some of them are in mean-motion resonances (MMR) Planet formation theory was successful in explaining the formation of 2 1 3 1 and other low resonances as a result of convergent migration However higher order resonances require high initial orbital eccentricities in order to be formed by this process and these are in general unexpected in a dissipative disk
We used VLT/VIMOS images in the V band to obtain light curves of extrasolar planetary transits OGLE-TR-111 and OGLE-TR-113 and candidate planetary transits OGLE-TR-82 OGLE-TR-86 OGLE-TR-91 OGLE-TR-106 OGLE-TR-109 OGLE-TR-110 OGLE-TR-159 OGLE-TR-167 OGLE-TR-170 OGLE-TR-171 Using difference imaging photometry we were able to achieve millimagnitude errors in the individual data points We present the analysis of the data and the light curves
by measuring transit amplitudes and ephemerides and by calculating geometrical parameters for some of the systems We observed 9 OGLE objects at the predicted transit moments Two other transits were shifted in time by a few hours For another seven objects we expected to observe transits during the VIMOS run
but they were not detected The stars OGLE-TR-111 and OGLE-TR-113 are probably the only OGLE objects in the observed sample to host planets with the other objects being very likely eclipsing binaries or multiple systems In this paper we also report on four new transiting candidates which we have found in the data
The study of the surface properties of Centaurs and Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) provides essential information about the early conditions and evolution of the outer Solar System Due to the faintness of most of these distant and icy bodies photometry currently constitutes the best technique to survey a statistically significant number of them
Our aim is to investigate color properties of a large sample of minor bodies of the outer Solar System and set their taxonomic classification We carried out visible and near-infrared photometry of Centaurs and TNOs making use respectively of the FORS2 and ISAAC instruments at the Very Large Telescope (European Southern Observatory)
Using G-mode analysis we derived taxonomic classifications according to the Barucci et al (2005a) system We report photometric observations of 31 objects 10 of them have their colors reported for the first time ever 28 Centaurs and TNOs have been assigned to a taxon We combined the entire sample of 38 objects taxonomically classified in the framework of our programme (28 objects from this work; 10 objects from DeMeo et al
Models for the steady state collisional evolution of low eccentricity planetesimal belts identify debris disks with hot dust at 1AU like eta Corvi and HD69830 as anomalous since collisional processing should have removed most of the planetesimal mass over their &gt;1 Gyr lifetimes This paper looks at the effect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e&gt;&gt;0
For an axisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e we find that M_{late} \propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3} For a scattered disk-like population (i e common pericentres) in the absence of dynamical evolution the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals with the largest eccentricity were present
Despite the increased remaining mass higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the collisional cascade until e&gt;0 99 partly because most collisions occur near pericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter However at high eccentricities (e&gt;0 97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre may be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also increase the probability of witnessing a recent collision
All of the imaging and spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single planetesimal population with pericentre at 0 75AU apocentre at 150AU and mass 5M_\oplus; however the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains challenging The mid-IR excess to HD69830 can be explained by the ongoing destruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentric planetesimal belt
The discovery of short-period Neptune-mass objects now including the remarkable system HD69830 (Lovis et al 2006) with three Neptune analogues raises difficult questions about current formation models which may require a global treatment of the protoplanetary disc Several formation scenarios have been proposed where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core accretion with type I migration (e
g Terquem &amp; Papaloizou 2007) and planetary atmosphere physics (e g Alibert et al 2006) To date published studies have considered only a small number of progenitors at late times This leaves unaddressed important questions about the global viability of the models We seek to determine whether the most natural model -- namely
taking the canonical oligarchic picture of core accretion and introducing type I migration -- can succeed in forming objects of 10 Earth masses and more in the innermost parts of the disc This problem is investigated using both traditional semianalytic methods for modelling oligarchic growth as well as a new parallel multi-zone N-body code designed specifically for treating planetary formation problems with large dynamic range (McNeil &amp; Nelson 2009)
We find that it is extremely difficult for oligarchic tidal migration models to reproduce the observed distribution Even under many variations of the typical parameters we form no objects of mass greater than 8 Earth masses By comparison it is relatively straightforward to form icy super-Earths We conclude that either the initial conditions of the protoplanetary discs in short-period Neptune systems were substantially different from the standard disc models we used
We present the results of a search for occultation events by objects at distances between 100 and 1000 AU in lightcurves from the Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) We searched for consecutive shallow flux reductions in the stellar lightcurves obtained by our survey between 7 February 2005 and 31 December 2006 with a total of $\sim4
We report the detection of the eclipse of the very-hot Jupiter WASP-12b via z&#39;-band time-series photometry obtained with the 3 5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory We measure a decrease in flux of 0 082+/-0 015% during the passage of the planet behind the star That planetary flux is equally well reproduced by atmospheric models with and without extra absorbers
and blackbody models with f &gt; 0 585+/-0 080 It is therefore necessary to measure the planet at other wavelengths to further constrain its atmospheric properties The eclipse appears centered at phase = 0 5100 (+0 0072 -0 0061) consistent with an orbital eccentricity of |e cos w| = 0
The BEST wide-angle telescope installed at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence and operated in remote control from Berlin by the Institut fuer Planetenforschung DLR has observed the CoRoT target fields prior to the mission The resulting archive of stellar photometric lightcurves is used to search for deep transit events announced during CoRoT&#39;s alarm-mode to aid in fast photometric confirmation of these events
The &#34;initial run&#34; field of CoRoT (IRa01) has been observed with BEST in November and December 2006 for 12 nights The first &#34;long run&#34; field (LRc01) was observed from June to September 2005 for 35 nights After standard CCD data reduction aperture photometry has been performed using the ISIS image subtraction method
About 30 000 lightcurves were obtained in each field Transits of the first detected planets by the CoRoT mission CoRoT-1b and CoRoT-2b were found in archived data of the BEST survey and their lightcurves are presented here Such detections provide useful information at the early stage of the organization of follow-up observations of satellite alarm-mode planet candidates
For its beautiful rings active atmosphere and mysterious magnetic field Saturn is a fascinating planet It also holds some of the keys to understanding the formation of our Solar System and the evolution of giant planets in general While the exploration by the Cassini-Huygens mission has led to great advances in our understanding of the planet and its moons
it has left us with puzzling questions What is the bulk composition of the planet? Does it have a helium core? Is it enriched in noble gases like Jupiter? What powers and controls its gigantic storms? We have learned that we can measure an outer magnetic field that is filtered from its non-axisymmetric components
but what is Saturn&#39;s inner magnetic field? What are the rings made of and when were they formed? These questions are crucial in several ways a detailed comparison of the compositions of Jupiter and Saturn is necessary to understand processes at work during the formation of these two planets and of the Solar System
This calls for the continued exploration of the second largest planet in our Solar System with a variety of means including remote observations and space missions Measurements of gravity and magnetic fields very close to the planet&#39;s cloud tops would be extremely valuable Very high spatial resolution images of the rings would provide details on their structure and the material that form them
The most successful model of comet dust presents comet particles as aggregates of submicron grains It qualitatively explains the spectral and angular change in the comet brightness and polarization and is consistent with the thermal infrared data and composition of the comet dust obtained {\it in situ} for comet 1P/Halley
However it experiences some difficulties in providing a quantitative fit to the observational data Here we present a model that considers comet dust as a mixture of aggregates and compact particles The model is based on the Giotto and Stardust mission findings that both aggregates (made mainly of organics silicates
and carbon) and solid silicate particles are present in the comet dust We simulate aggregates as {\bf Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregates (BCCA)} and compact particles as polydisperse spheroids with some distribution of the aspect ratio The particles follow a power-law size distribution with the power -3 that is close to the one obtained for comet dust {\it in situ}
at studies of the Stardust returned samples and the results of ground-based observations of comets The model provides a good fit to the angular polarization curve It also reproduces the positive spectral gradient of polarization red color of the dust and {\bf low albedo It also has the ratio of compact to fluffy particles close to the one found {\it in situ} for comet 1P/Halley} and the mass ratio of silicate to carbonaceous materials equal to unity that is in accordance with the elemental abundances of Halley&#39;s dust found by Giotto mission
With the advent of high-resolution infrared spectrographs Radial Velocity (RV) searches enter into a new domain As of today the most important technical question to address is which wavelength reference is the most suitable for high-precision RV measurements <br>In this work we explore the usage of atmospheric absorption features We make use of CRIRES data on two programs and three different targets
We re-analyze the data of the TW Hya campaign reaching a dispersion of about 6 m/s on the RV standard in a time scale of roughly 1 week We confirm the presence of a low-amplitude RV signal on TW Hya itself roughly 3 times smaller than the one reported at visible wavelengths
We present RV measurements of Gl 86 as well showing that our approach is capable of detecting the signal induced by a planet and correctly quantifying it <br>Our data show that CRIRES is capable of reaching a RV precision of less than 10 m/s in a time-scale of one week
Several processes can cause the shape of an extrasolar giant planet&#39;s shadow as viewed in transit to depart from circular In addition to rotational effects cloud formation non-homogenous haze production and movement and dynamical effects (winds) could also be important When such a planet transits its host star as seen from Earth
the asphericity will introduce a deviation in the transit lightcurve relative to the transit of a perfectly spherical (or perfectly oblate) planet We develop a theoretical framework to interpret planet shapes We then generate predictions for transiting planet shapes based on a published theoretical dynamical model of HD189733b Using these shape models we show that planet shapes are unlikely to introduce detectable lightcurve deviations (those &gt;~1e-5 of the host star)
We present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary disks carried in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0 3 mJy) using the IRAM PdBI With our high detection rate of 17/19 we provide the first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources
This enables us to study statistically the mm SED slopes and dust properties of faint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method With these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21 isolated disks around T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region
Together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mm interferometric studies we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energy distribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths using two-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takes properly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth
We find evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that have grown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of our sample confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects This indicates that the dust coagulation from ISM dust to mm-sized grains is a very fast process in protoplanetary disks
that appears to occur before a young stellar object enters the Class II evolutionary stage Also the amount of these large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all the Class II evolutionary stage indicating that mechanisms slowing down the dust inward migration are playing an important role in the Taurus-Auriga protoplanetary disks
The Kuiper belt is a remnant of the primordial Solar System Measurements of its size distribution constrain its accretion and collisional history and the importance of material strength of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) Small sub-km sized KBOs elude direct detection but the signature of their occultations of background stars should be detectable
Observations at both optical and X-ray wavelengths claim to have detected such occultations but their implied KBO abundances are inconsistent with each other and far exceed theoretical expectations Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an occultation by a body with a 500 m radius at a distance of 45 AU
The probability of this event to occur due to random statistical fluctuations within our data set is about 2% Our survey yields a surface density of KBOs with radii larger than 250 m of 2 1^{+4 8}_{-1 7} x 10^7 deg^{-2} ruling out inferred surface densities from previous claimed detections by more than 5 sigma
The formation of planets within a disc must operate within the time frame of disc dispersal it is thus crucial to establish what is the dominant process that disperses the gaseous component of discs around young stars Planet formation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the central young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal mechanisms
[abridged] In this paper we use the different metallicity dependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate between these two processes We study the effects of metallicity Z on the dispersal timescale t_phot in the context of a photoevaporation model by means of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium irradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source
Our models show t_phot \propto Z^0 52 for a pure photoevaporation model By means of analytical estimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on metallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet formation A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should therefore be able to distinguish between the two models
A recent study by Yasui et al in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~- 0 7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0 001) provides preliminary observational evidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities in agreement with the predictions of a pure photoevaporation model [abridged] We finally develop an analytical framework to study the effects of metallicity dependent photoevaporation on the formation of gas giants in the core accretion scenario
We explore the initial conditions for fragments in the extended regions ($r\gtrsim 50$ AU) of gravitationally unstable disks We combine analytic estimates for the fragmentation of spiral arms with 3D SPH simulations to show that initial fragment masses are in the gas giant regime These initial fragments will have substantial angular momentum
and should form disks with radii of a few AU We show that clumps will survive for multiple orbits before they undergo a second rapid collapse due to H$_2$ dissociation and that it is possible to destroy bound clumps by transporting them into the inner disk The consequences of disrupted clumps for planet formation
In order to explain the inflated radii of some transiting extrasolar giant planets we investigate a tidal heating scenario for the inflated planets WASP-4b WASP-6b WASP-12b WASP-15b and TrES-4 To do so we assume that they retain a nonzero eccentricity possibly by dint of continuing interaction with a third body
We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is then required to fit the radius of each planet and we explore how this additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass of a heavy-element central core There is a degeneracy between the core mass $M_{\rm core}$ and the heating $\dot{E}_{\rm heating}$
Therefore in the case of tidal heating there is for each planet a range of the couple $\{M_{\rm core} e^2/Q&#39;_p\}$ that can lead to the same radius where $Q&#39;_p$ is the tidal dissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity With this in mind we also investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b
which can admit solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating A substantial improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters $\{M_{\rm core} Q&#39;_p\}$ Further independent constraints on either of these parameters would through our calculations constrain the other
Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming few years While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements
We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core silicate mantles water layers and H/He envelopes) We apply our model to CoRoT-7b GJ 436b and HAT-P-11b Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature
while for CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b&#39;s mass and radius assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth&#39;s composition depends on the planet&#39;s density; for similar observational uncertainties
high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints Finally we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet&#39;s interior composition On the whole with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained
The origin and long-term evolution of Saturn&#39;s rings is still an unsolved problem in modern planetary science In this chapter we review the current state of our knowledge on this long-standing question for the main rings (A Cassini Division B C) the F Ring and the diffuse rings (E and G)
During the Voyager era models of evolutionary processes affecting the rings on long time scales (erosion viscous spreading accretion ballistic transport etc ) had suggested that Saturn&#39;s rings are not older than 100 My In addition Saturn&#39;s large system of diffuse rings has been thought to be the result of material loss from one or more of Saturn&#39;s satellites
In the Cassini era high spatial and spectral resolution data have allowed progress to be made on some of these questions Discoveries such as the &#39;&#39;propellers&#39;&#39; in the A ring the shape of ring-embedded moonlets the clumps in the F Ring and Enceladus&#39; plume provide new constraints on evolutionary processes in Saturn&#39;s rings
At the same time advances in numerical simulations over the last 20 years have opened the way to realistic models of the rings&#39;s fine scale structure and progress in our understanding of the formation of the Solar System provides a better-defined historical context in which to understand ring formation All these elements have important implications for the origin and long-term evolution of Saturn&#39;s rings
They strengthen the idea that Saturn&#39;s rings are very dynamical and rapidly evolving while new arguments suggest that the rings could be older than previously believed provided that they are regularly renewed Key evolutionary processes timescales and possible scenarios for the rings&#39;s origin are reviewed in the light of t
Equation of motion for the galactic tide is treated for the case of a comet situated in the Oort cloud of comets We take into account that galactic potential and mass density depend on a distance from the galactic equator and on a distance from the rotational axis of the Galaxy
Secular evolution of orbital elements is presented New terms generated by the Sun&#39;s oscillation about the galactic plane are considered The inclusion of the new terms into the equation of motion of the comet leads to orbital evolution which may be significantly different from the conventional approach The usage of the secular time derivatives is limited to the cases when orbital period of the comet is much less than i) the period of oscillations of the Sun around the galactic equator
Measurements of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind find a non-zero right-handed magnetic helicity This has been interpreted as evidence for ion cyclotron damping However theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the majority of the energy in solar wind turbulence resides in low frequency anisotropic kinetic Alfven wave fluctuations that are not subject to ion cyclotron damping
We present Hubble Space Telescope optical coronagraphic polarization imaging observations of the dusty debris disk HD 61005 The scattered light intensity image and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear asymmetric swept back component suggestive of significant interaction with the ambient interstellar medium The combination of our new data with the published 1
implying predominantly sub-micron sized grains We investigate possible explanations that could account for the observed swept back asymmetric morphology Previous work has suggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold unusually dense interstellar cloud However limits on the intervening interstellar gas column density from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this possibility unlikely
Instead HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits This mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a typical cloud crossing time For a counterintuitive relative flow direction--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated by these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology
Future observational studies constraining the direction of the relative interstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future modeling Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005 we expect that interstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in other debris disk systems such as HD 15115 and Delta-Velorum
Ragozzine &amp; Brown [2007] presented a list of candidate members of the first collisional family to be found among the trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) the one associated with (136108) Haumea (2003 EL61) We aim to identify which of the candidate members of the Haumea collisional family are true members by searching for water ice on their surfaces
We also attempt to test the theory that the family members are made of almost pure water ice by using optical light-curves to constrain their densities We use optical and near-infrared photometry to identify water ice in particular using the (J - H_S) colour as a sensitive measure of the absorption feature at 1
We use the CH_4 filter of the new Hawk-I instrument at the VLT as a short H-band (H_S) for this as it is more sensitive to the water ice feature than the usual H filter We report colours for 22 candidate family members including NIR colours for 15 We confirm that 2003 SQ317 and 2005 CB79 are family members
bringing the total number of confirmed family members to 10 We reject 8 candidates as having no water ice absorption based on our Hawk-I measurements and 5 more based on their optical colours The combination of the large proportion of rejected candidates and time lost to weather prevent us from putting strong constraints on the density of the family members based on the light-curves obtained so far; we can still say that none of the family members (except Haumea) require a large density to explain their light-curve
A decade ago the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planet provided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door to spectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres As such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large
nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively Doppler studies and microlensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1 9-10 times the Earth&#39;s mass (M_Earth) called super-Earths The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future
Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ 1214b which has a mass of 6 55 M_Earth and a radius 2 68 times Earth&#39;s radius (R_Earth) indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0
Probabilities of collisions of migrating small bodies and dust particles produced by these bodies with planets were studied Various Jupiter-family comets Halley-type comets long-period comets trans-Neptunian objects and asteroids were considered The total probability of collisions of any considered body or particle with all planets did not exceed 0 2
The amount of water delivered from outside of Jupiter&#39;s orbit to the Earth during the formation of the giant planets could exceed the amount of water in Earth&#39;s oceans The ratio of the mass of water delivered to a planet by Jupiter-family comets or Halley-type comets to the mass of the planet can be greater for Mars
Microlensing and occultation are generally studied in the geometric optics limit However diffraction may be important when recently discovered Kuiper-Belt objects (KBOs) occult distant stars In particular the effects of diffraction become more important as the wavelength of the observation and the distance to the KBO increase For sufficiently distant and massive KBOs or Oort cloud objects not only is diffraction important but so is gravitational lensing
Recent surveys have revealed a lack of close-in planets around evolved stars more massive than 1 2 Msun Such planets are common around solar-mass stars We have calculated the orbital evolution of planets around stars with a range of initial masses and have shown how planetary orbits are affected by the evolution of the stars all the way to the tip of the Red Giant Branch (RGB)
We find that tidal interaction can lead to the engulfment of close-in planets by evolved stars The engulfment is more efficient for more-massive planets and less-massive stars These results may explain the observed semi-major axis distribution of planets around evolved stars with masses larger than 1 5 Msun <br>Our results also suggest that massive planets may form more efficiently around intermediate-mass stars
We develop a method to infer or rule out the presence of an atmosphere on a tidally-locked hot super Earth The question of atmosphere retention is a fundamental one especially for planets orbiting M stars due to the star&#39;s long-duration active phase and corresponding potential for stellar-induced planetary atmospheric escape and erosion
Tidally-locked planets with no atmosphere are expected to show a Lambertian-like thermal phase curve causing the combined light of the planet-star system to vary with planet orbital phase <br>We report Spitzer 8 micron IRAC observations of GJ 876 taken over 32 continuous hours and reaching a relative photometric precision of 3
This translates to a 3 sigma limit of 5 13e-05 on a planet thermal phase curve amplitude Despite the almost photon-noise limited data we are unable to conclusively infer the presence of an atmosphere or rule one out on the non-transiting short-period super Earth GJ 876d The limiting factor in our observations was the miniscule
monotonic photometric variation of the slightly active host M star because the partial sine wave due to the planet has a component in common with the stellar linear trend The proposed method is nevertheless very promising for transiting hot super Earths with the James Webb Space Telescope and is critical for establishing observational constraints for atmospheric escape
We report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transiting extrasolar planet WASP-19b The planet has mass Mpl = 1 15 \pm 0 08 MJ radius Rpl = 1 31 \pm 0 06 RJ and orbital period P = 0 7888399 \pm 0 0000008 days Through spectroscopic analysis
we determine the host star to be a slightly super-solar metallicity ([M/H] = 0 1 \pm 0 1 dex) G-dwarf with Teff = 5500 \pm 100 K In addition we detect periodic sinusoidal flux variations in the light curve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of Prot = 10
The relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that either WASP-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 Myr old) or tidal interactions between the two bodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting in the spin-up of the star Due to the detection of the rotation period this system has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidal quality factor
We report the discovery and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect of Kepler-8b a transiting planet identified by the NASA Kepler Mission Kepler photometry and Keck-HIRES radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet around this F8IV subgiant host star The planet has a radius RP = 1 419 RJ and a mass
MP = 0 60 MJ yielding a density of 0 26 g cm^-3 among the lowest density planets known The orbital period is P = 3 523 days and orbital semima jor axis is 0 0483+0 0006/-0 0012 AU The star has a large rotational v sin i of 10
both properties deleterious to precise Doppler measurements The velocities are indeed noisy with scatter of 30 m s^-1 but exhibit a period and phase consistent with the planet implied by the photometry We securely detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect confirming the planet&#39;s existence and establishing its orbit as prograde We measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbital axis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26
We numerically investigate the long-term dynamics of the Saturn&#39;s small satellites Methone (S/2004 S1) Anthe (S/2007 S4) and Pallene (S/2004 S2) In our numerical integrations these satellites are disturbed by non-spherical shape of Saturn and the six nearest regular satellites The stability of the small bodies is studied here by analyzing long-term evolution of their orbital elements
<br>We show that long-term evolution of Pallene is dictated by a quasi secular resonance involving the ascending nodes ($\Omega$) and longitudes of pericentric distances ($\varpi$) of Mimas (subscript 1) and Pallene (subscript 2) which critical argument is $\varpi_2-\varpi_1-\Omega_1+\Omega_2$ Long-term orbital evolution of Methone and Anthe are probably chaotic since i) their orbits randomly cross the orbit of Mimas in time scales of thousands years); ii) numerical simulations involving both small satellites are strongly affected by small changes in the initial conditions
In an effort to understand the origin of the Main Belt Comets (MBCs) 7968 Elst-Pizzaro 118401 and P/2005 U1 the dynamics of these three icy asteroids and a large number of hypothetical MBCs were studied Results of extensive numerical integrations of these objects suggest that these MBCs were formed in-place through the collisional break up of a larger precursor body
Simulations point specifically to the Themis family of asteroids as the origin of these objects and rule out the possibility of a cometary origin (i e inward scattering of comets from outer solar system and their primordial capture in the asteroid belt) Results also indicate that while 7968 Elst-Pizzaro and 118401 maintain their orbits for 1 Gyr
P/2005 U1 diffuses chaotically in eccentricity and becomes unstable in ~20 Myr The latter suggest that this MBC used to be a member of the Themis family and is now escaping away Numerical integrations of the orbits of hypothetical MBCs in the vicinity of the Themis family show a clustering of stable orbits (with eccentricities smaller than 0
) suggesting that many more MBCs may exist in the vicinity of this family (although they might have not been activated yet) The details of the results of simulations and the constraints on the models of the formation and origins of MBCs are presented and their implications for the detection of more of these objects are discussed
Aegaeon (Saturn LIII S/2008 S1) is a small satellite of Saturn that orbits within a bright arc of material near the inner edge of Saturn&#39;s G ring This object was observed in 21 images with Cassini&#39;s Narrow-Angle Camera between June 15 (DOY 166) 2007 and February 20 (DOY 51) 2009
If Aegaeon has similar surface scattering properties as other nearby small Saturnian satellites (Pallene Methone and Anthe) then its diameter is approximately 500 m Orbit models based on numerical integrations of the full equations of motion show that Aegaeon&#39;s orbital motion is strongly influenced by multiple resonances with Mimas In particular
like the G-ring arc it inhabits Aegaeon is trapped in the 7 6 corotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas Aegaeon Anthe and Methone therefore form a distinctive class of objects in the Saturn system small moons in co-rotation eccentricity resonances with Mimas associated with arcs of debris Comparisons among these different ring-arc systems reveal that Aegaeon&#39;s orbit is closer to the exact resonance than Anthe&#39;s and Methone&#39;s orbits are
We report the discovery and confirmation of Kepler-7b a transiting planet with unusually low density The mass is less than half that of Jupiter Mp = 0 43 Mj but the radius is fifty percent larger Rp = 1 48 Rj The resulting density 0 17 g/cc is the second lowest reported so far for an extrasolar planet
The orbital period is fairly long P = 4 886 days and the host star is not much hotter than the Sun Teff = 6000 K However it is more massive and considerably larger than the sun Mstar = 1 35 Msun and Rstar = 1 84 Rsun and must be near the end of its life on the Main Sequence
We discuss the possibility of screening the atmosphere of exomoons for habitability We concentrate on Earth-like satellites of extrasolar giant planets (EGP) which orbit in the Habitable Zone of their host stars The detectability of exomoons for EGP in the Habitable Zone has recently been shown to be feasible with the Kepler Mission or equivalent photometry using transit duration observations
Using the Earth itself as a proxy we show the potential and limits of spectroscopy to detect biomarkers on an Earth-like exomoon and discuss effects of tidal locking for such potential habitats Transmission spectroscopy of exomoons is a unique potential tool to screen them for habitability in the near future
As of today over 40 planetary systems have been discovered in binary star systems In all cases the configuration appears to be circumstellar where the planets orbit around one of the stars the secondary acting as a perturber The formation of planets in binary star systems is more difficult than around single stars due to the gravitational action of the companion on the dynamics of the protoplanetary disk
In this contribution we first briefly present the relevant observational evidence for planets in binary systems Then the dynamical influence that a secondary companion has on a circumstellar disk will be analyzed through fully hydrodynamical simulations We demonstrate that the disk becomes eccentric and shows a coherent precession around the primary star
Finally fully hydrodynamical simulations of evolving protoplanets embedded in disks in binary star systems are presented We investigate how the orbital evolution of protoplanetary embryos and their mass growth from cores to massive planets might be affected in this very dynamical environment We consider in particular the planet orbiting the primary in the system Gamma Cephei
Recent observation of microlensing technique reveals two giant planets at 2 3 AU and 4 6 AU around the star OGLE-06-109L The eccentricity of the outer planet (ec) is estimated to be 0 11(+0 17 -0 04) comparable to that of Saturn (0 01-0 09) The similarities between the OGLE-06-109L system and the solar system indicate that they may have passed through similar histories during their formation stage
In this paper we investigate the dynamics and formation of the orbital architecture in the OGLE-06-109L system For the present two planets with their nominal locations the secular motions are stable as long as their eccentricities (eb; ec) fulfill eb^2 + ec^2 &lt; = 0 3^2 Earth-size bodies might be formed and are stable in the habitable zone (0
Three possible scenarios may be accounted for formation of eb and ec (i) convergent migration of two planets and the 3 1 MMR trapping; (ii) planetary scattering; (iii) divergent migration and the 3 1 MMR crossing As we showed that the probability for the two giant planets in 3 1 MMR is low (~3%)
scenario (i) is less likely According to models (ii) and (iii) the final eccentricity of inner planet (eb) may oscillate between [0-0 06] comparable to that of Jupiter (0 03-0 06) An inspection of eb ec secular motion may be helpful to understand which model is really responsible for the eccentricity formation
The direct images of giant extrasolar planets recently obtained around several main sequence stars represent a major step in the study of planetary systems These high-dynamic range images are among the most striking results obtained by the current generation of high angular resolution instruments which will be superseded by a new generation of instruments in the coming years
It is therefore an appropriate time to review the contributions of high angular resolution visible/infrared techniques to the rapidly growing field of extrasolar planetary science During the last 20 years the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope of adaptive optics on 4- to 10-m class ground-based telescopes and of long-baseline infrared stellar interferometry has opened a new viewpoint on the formation and evolution of planetary systems
By spatially resolving the optically thick circumstellar discs of gas and dust where planets are forming these instruments have considerably improved our models of early circumstellar environments and have thereby provided new constraints on planet formation theories High angular resolution techniques are also directly tracing the mechanisms governing the early evolution of planetary embryos and the dispersal of optically thick material around young stars
We present the discovery of three new giant planets around three metal-deficient stars HD5388b (1 96M_Jup) HD181720b (0 37M_Jup) and HD190984b (3 1M_Jup) All the planets have moderately eccentric orbits (ranging from 0 26 to 0 57) and long orbital periods (from 777 to 4885 days) Two of the stars (HD181720 and HD190984) were part of a program searching for giant planets around a sample of ~100 moderately metal-poor stars
We present high-precision photometry of five consecutive transits of WASP-18 an extrasolar planetary system with one of the shortest orbital periods known Through the use of telescope defocussing we achieve a photometric precision of 0 47 to 0 83 mmag per observation over complete transit events The data are analysed using the JKTEBOP code and three different sets of stellar evolutionary models
We find the mass and radius of the planet to be M_b = 10 43 +/- 0 30 +/- 0 24 Mjup R_b = 1 165 +/- 0 055 +/- 0 014 Rjup (statistical and systematic errors) respectively The systematic errors in the orbital separation and the stellar and planetary masses
arising from the use of theoretical predictions are of a similar size to the statistical errors and set a limit on our understanding of the WASP-18 system We point out that seven of the nine known massive transiting planets (M_b &gt; 3 Mjup) have eccentric orbits whereas significant orbital eccentricity has been detected for only four of the 46 less massive planets
The recently discovered planetary system HD45364 which consists of a Jupiter and Saturn mass planet is very likely in a 3 2 mean motion resonance The standard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration of two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc When the planets are initially separated by a period ratio larger than two
convergent migration will most likely lead to a very stable 2 1 resonance for moderate migration rates To avoid this fate formation of the planets close enough to prevent this resonance may be proposed However such a simultaneous formation of the planets within a small annulus seems to be very unlikely
<br>Rapid type III migration of the outer planet crossing the 2 1 resonance is one possible way around this problem In this paper we investigate this idea in detail We present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate and confirm this with N-body and hydrodynamical simulations If the dynamical history of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that forms a resonant configuration
we predict that the orbital parameters of the two planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that <br>We use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial velocity curve and compare it to observations Our model can explain the observational data as good as the previously reported fit
This paper reports a blind search for magnetospheric emissions from planets around nearby stars Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by stellar winds stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any orbiting planets Using various stellar catalogs
we selected nearby stars (&lt;~ 30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (&lt; 3 Gyr) We constructed different samples from the stellar catalogs finding between 100 and several hundred stars We stacked images from the 74-MHz (4-m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) obtaining 3\sigma limits on planetary emission in the stacked images of between 10 and 33 mJy
These flux density limits correspond to average planetary luminosities less than 5--10 x 10^{23} erg/s Using recent models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity density and magnetic field with stellar age we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar winds relative to the Sun in our samples The typical kinetic energy carried by the stellar winds in our samples is 15--50 times larger than that of the Sun
and the typical magnetic energy is 5--10 times larger If we assume that every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors our limits on planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of 10--100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical sense
The Saturnian coorbital satellites Janus and Epimetheus present a unique dynamical configuration in the Solar System because of high-amplitude horseshoe orbits due to a mass ratio of order unity As a consequence they swap their orbits every 4 years while their orbital periods is about 0 695 days Recently Tiscareno et al
(2009) got observational informations on the shapes and the rotational states of these satellites In particular they detected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus and a large libration of Epimetheus We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the rotation of these satellites in using these observed data
and to compare it to the observed rotations We consider the two satellites as triaxial rigid bodies and we perform numerical integrations of the system in assuming the free librations as damped The periods of the three free librations we get associated with the 3 dimensions are respectively 1 267
and 0 747 1 804 and 5 542 days for Epimetheus The proximity of 0 747 days to the orbital period causes a high sensitivity of the librations of Epimetheus to the moments of inertia Our theory explains the amplitude of the librations of Janus and the error bars of the librations of Epimetheus
Extrasolar planets are not named and are referred to only by their assigned scientific designation The reason given by the IAU to not name the planets is that it is considered impractical as planets are expected to be common I advance some reasons as to why this logic is flawed
and suggest names for the 403 extrasolar planet candidates known as of Oct 2009 The names follow a scheme of association with the constellation that the host star pertains to and therefore are mostly drawn from Roman-Greek mythology Other mythologies may also be used given that a suitable association is established
The asteroid (21) Lutetia is the target of a planned close encounter by the Rosetta spacecraft in July 2010 To prepare for that flyby Lutetia has been extensively observed by a variety of astronomical facilities We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to determine the albedo of Lutetia over a wide wavelength range
extending from ~150 nm to ~700 nm Using data from a variety of HST filters and a ground-based visible light spectrum we employed synthetic photometry techniques to derive absolute fluxes for Lutetia New results from ground-based measurements of Lutetia&#39;s size and shape were used to convert the absolute fluxes into albedos
We present our best model for the spectral energy distribution of Lutetia over the wavelength range 120-800 nm There appears to be a steep drop in the albedo (by a factor of ~2) for wavelengths shorter than ~300 nm Nevertheless the far ultraviolet albedo of Lutetia (~10%) is considerably larger than that of typical C-chondrite material (~4%)
The geometric albedo at 550 nm is 16 5 +/- 1% Lutetia&#39;s reflectivity is not consistent with a metal-dominated surface at infrared or radar wavelengths and its albedo at all wavelengths (UV-visibile-IR-radar) is larger than observed for typical primitive chondritic material We derive a relatively high FUV albedo of ~10%
The giant planet atmospheres exhibit alternating prograde (eastward) and retrograde (westward) jets of different speeds and widths with an equatorial jet that is prograde on Jupiter and Saturn and retrograde on Uranus and Neptune The jets are variously thought to be driven by differential radiative heating of the upper atmosphere or by intrinsic heat fluxes emanating from the deep interior
But existing models cannot account for the different flow configurations on the giant planets in an energetically consistent manner Here a three-dimensional general circulation model is used to show that the different flow configurations can be reproduced by mechanisms universal across the giant planets if differences in their radiative heating and intrinsic heat fluxes are taken into account
Whether the equatorial jet is prograde or retrograde depends on whether the deep intrinsic heat fluxes are strong enough that convection penetrates into the upper troposphere and generates strong equatorial Rossby waves there Prograde equatorial jets result if convective Rossby wave generation is strong and low-latitude angular momentum flux divergence owing to baroclinic eddies generated off the equator is sufficiently weak (Jupiter and Saturn)
Retrograde equatorial jets result if either convective Rossby wave generation is weak or absent (Uranus) or low-latitude angular momentum flux divergence owing to baroclinic eddies is sufficiently strong (Neptune) The different speeds and widths of the off-equatorial jets depend among other factors on the differential radiative heating of the atmosphere and the altitude of the jets
Voyager images and Cassini occultation data have previously shown that the behavior of the outer edge of Saturn&#39;s massive B ring is determined only in part by a static response to the 2 1 inner Lindblad resonance with Mimas In Cassini images of this region we find in addition to the expected wavenumber-2 forced distortion
evidence for unforced self-excited wavenumber-3 wavenumber-2 and wavenumber-1 normal modes These are the first observations to suggest substantial wave amplification in Saturn&#39;s broad rings Moreover the presence of these free modes strongly implicates viscous overstability as their underlying cause and by inference the cause for most if not all of the unforced structures throughout the high-mass-density B ring and in other high-mass-density regions in Saturn&#39;s rings
Analysis of each of the inferred waves reveals a consistent lower bound on the average surface mass density of ~ 44 g/cm^2 for the outer 250 km of the ring though the true surface density could be as high as 100 g/cm^2 or higher Interference between the forced and free wavenumber-2 modes yields a total wavenumber-2 pattern that varies in amplitude and orientation with a characteristic period of ~ 5
Equation of motion for a comet in the Oort cloud is numerically solved Orbital evolution of the comet under the action of the gravity of the Sun and the Galaxy is presented for various initial conditions <br>Oscillations of the Sun with respect to the galactic equatorial plane are taken into account
Real values of physical quantities concerning the gravitational action of the galactic neighbourhood of the Sun are important The results are compared with currently used more simple models of the galactic tide It turns out that physically improved models yield results which significantly differ from the results obtained on the basis of the conventional models
E g the number of returns of the comets into the inner part of the Solar System are about two times greater than it is in the conventional models <br>It seems that a comet from the Oort cloud can be a source of the dinosaurs extinction at about 65 Myr ago
We aim to examine the detailed disc structure that arises in a misaligned binary system as a function of the disc aspect ratio h viscosity parameter alpha disc outer radius R and binary inclination angle gamma_F We also aim to examine the conditions that lead to an inclined disc being disrupted by strong differential precession
We use a grid-based hydrodynamic code to perform 3D simulations This code has a relatively low numerical viscosity compared with the SPH schemes that have been used previously to study inclined discs This allows the influence of viscosity on the disc evolution to be tightly controlled We find that for thick discs (h=0
efficient warp communication in the discs allows them to precess as rigid bodies with very little warping or twisting Such discs are observed to align with the binary orbit plane on the viscous evolution time Thinner discs with higher viscosity in which warp communication is less efficient develop significant twists before achieving a state of rigid-body precession
Under the most extreme conditions we consider (h=0 01 alpha=0 005 and alpha=0 1) we find that discs can become broken or disrupted by strong differential precession Discs that become highly twisted are observed to align with the binary orbit plane on timescales much shorter than the viscous timescale possibly on the precession time
We find agreement with previous studies that show that thick discs with low viscosity experience mild warping and precess rigidly We also find that as h is decreased substantially discs may be disrupted by strong differential precession but for disc thicknesses that are significantly less (h=0 01) than those found in previous studies (h=0
We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the accretion of pebbles and rocks onto protoplanets of a few hundred kilometres in radius including two-way drag force coupling between particles and the protoplanetary disc gas Particle streams interacting with the gas far out within the Hill sphere of the protoplanet spiral into a prograde circumplanetary disc
Material is accreted onto the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10%-50% of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts
The up to 150 day uninterrupted high-precision photometry of about 100000 stars - provided so far by the exoplanet channel of the CoRoT space telescope - gave a new perspective on the planet population of our galactic neighbourhood The seven planets with very accurate parameters widen the range of known planet properties in almost any respect
Giant planets have been detected at low metallicity rapidly rotating and active spotted stars CoRoT-3 populated the brown dwarf desert and closed the gap of measured physical properties between standard giant planets and very low mass stars CoRoT extended the known range of planet masses down to 5 Earth masses and up to 21 Jupiter masses
the radii to less than 2 Earth radii and up to the most inflated hot Jupiter found so far and the periods of planets discovered by transits to 9 days Two CoRoT planets have host stars with the lowest content of heavy elements known to show a transit hinting towards a different planet-host-star-metallicity relation then the one found by radial-velocity search programs
Finally the properties of the CoRoT-7b prove that terrestrial planets with a density close to Earth exist outside the Solar System The detection of the secondary transit of CoRoT-1 at the $10^{-5}$-level and the very clear detection of the 1 7 Earth radii of CoRoT-7b at $3 5 10^{-4}$ relative flux are promising evidence of CoRoT being able to detect even smaller
We investigate a new strategy which can defeat the (in)famous Carter&#39;s &#34;anthropic&#34; argument against extraterrestrial life and intelligence In contrast to those already considered by Wilson Livio and others the present approach is based on relaxing hidden uniformitarian assumptions considering instead a dynamical succession of evolutionary regimes governed by both global (Galaxy-wide) and local (planet- or planetary system-limited) regulation mechanisms
This is in accordance with recent developments in both astrophysics and evolutionary biology Notably our increased understanding of the nature of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts as well as of strong coupling between the Solar System and the Galaxy on one hand and the theories of &#34;punctuated equilibria&#34; of Eldredge and Gould and &#34;macroevolutionary regimes&#34; of Jablonski
Valentine et al on the other are in full accordance with the regulation- mechanism picture The application of this particular strategy highlights the limits of application of Carter&#39;s argument and indicates that in the real universe its applicability conditions are not satisfied We conclude that drawing far-reaching conclusions about the scarcity of extraterrestrial intelligence and the prospects of our efforts to detect it on the basis of this argument is unwarranted
One of the most fundamental problems in the study of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) is to know their true physical size Without knowledge of their albedos we are not able to distinguish large and dark from small and bright KBOs Spitzer produced rough estimates of the sizes and albedos of about 20 KBOs
and the Herschel space telescope will improve on those initial measurements by extending the sample to the ~150 brightest KBOs SPICA&#39;s higher sensitivity instruments should allow us not only to broaden the sample to smaller KBOs but also to achieve a statistically significant sample of KBO thermal light curves (Herschel will measure only six objects)
We present a new data set of transit observations of the TrES-2b exoplanet taken in spring 2009 using the 1 2m Oskar-Luhning telescope (OLT) of Hamburg Observatory and the 2 2m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory using BUSCA (Bonn University Simultaneous CAmera) Both the new OLT data taken with the same instrumental setup as our data taken in 2008
as well as the simultaneously recorded multicolor BUSCA data confirm the low inclination values reported previously and in fact suggest that the TrES-2b exoplanet has already passed the first inclination threshold (i_min 1 = 83 417) and is not eclipsing the full stellar surface any longer Using the multi-band BUSCA data we demonstrate that the multicolor light curves can be consistently fitted with a given set of limb darkening coefficients without the need to adjust these coefficients
and further we can demonstrate that wavelength dependent stellar radius changes must be small as expected from theory Our new observations provide further evidence for a change of the orbit inclination of the transiting extrasolar planet TrES-2b reported previously We examine in detail possible causes for this inclination change and argue that the observed change should be interpreted as nodal regression
While the assumption of an oblate host star requires an unreasonably large second harmonic coefficient the existence of a third body in the form of an additional planet would provide a very natural explanation for the observed secular orbit change Given the lack of clearly observed short-term variations of transit timing and our observed secular nodal regression rate
The Beta Pictoris Moving Group is a nearby stellar association of young (12Myr) co-moving stars including the classical debris disk star beta Pictoris Due to their proximity and youth they are excellent targets when searching for submillimetre emission from cold extended dust components produced by collisions in Kuiper-Belt-like disks They also allow an age independent study of debris disk properties as a function of other stellar parameters
We observed 7 infrared-excess stars in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group with the LABOCA bolometer array operating at a central wavelength of 870 micron at the 12-m submillimetre telescope APEX The main emission at these wavelengths comes from large cold dust grains which constitute the main part of the total dust mass
and hence for an optically thin case make better estimates on the total dust mass than earlier infrared observations Fitting the spectral energy distribution with combined optical and infrared photometry gives information on the temperature and radial extent of the disk From our sample beta Pic HD181327 and HD172555 were detected with at least 3-sigma certainty
while all others are below 2-sigma and considered non-detections The image of beta Pic shows an offset flux density peak located near the south-west extension of the disk similar to the one previously found by SCUBA at the JCMT We present SED fits for detected sources and give an upper limit on the dust mass for undetected ones
The findings of more than 350 extrasolar planets most of them nontransiting Hot Jupiters have revealed correlations between the metallicity of the main-sequence (MS) host stars and planetary incidence This connection can be used to calculate the planet formation probability around other stars not yet known to have planetary companions
We locate the promising spots for current transit surveys on the celestial plane and strive for absolute values of the expected number of transits in general We used data of the Tycho catalog for about 1 million objects to locate all the stars with 0m &lt; m_V &lt; 11 5m on the celestial plane
We took several empirical relations between the parameters listed in the Tycho catalog such as distance to Earth m_V and (B-V) and those parameters needed to account for the probability of a star to host an observable transiting exoplanet The empirical relations between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence combined with geometrical considerations were used to yield transit probabilities for the MS stars in the Tycho catalog
Magnitude variations in the FOV were simulated to test whether this fluctuations would be detected by BEST XO SuperWASP and HATNet We present a sky map of the expected number of Hot Jupiter transit events on the basis of the Tycho catalog The comparison between the considered transit surveys yields significantly differing maps of the expected transit detections
The sky-integrated magnitude distribution predicts 20 Hot Jupiter transits with orbital periods between 1 5 d and 50 d and m_V &lt; 8m of which two are currently known In total we expect 3412 Hot Jupiter transits to occur in front of MS stars within the given magnitude range The most promising observing site on Earth is at latitude = -1
At present microlensing light curves from different telescopes and filters are photometrically aligned by fitting them to a common model We present a second method based on photometry of common field stars If two spectral responses are similar (or the color of the source is known) then this technique can resolve important ambiguities that frequently arise when predicting the future course of the event
and that occasionally persist even when the event is over Or if the spectral responses are different it can be used to derive the color of the source when that is unknown We present the essential elements of this technique and apply it to the case of MOA-2007-BLG-192 an important planetary event for which the system may be a terrestrial planet orbiting a brown dwarf or very low mass star
The Kepler Mission launched on Mar 6 2009 was designed with the explicit capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars using the transit photometry method Results from just forty-three days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses
radii and orbital periods Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique precise extended and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise To fully understand the methodology processes and eventually the results from the mission
Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets orbiting Solar-like stars Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF)
defined as the composite of Kepler&#39;s optical point spread function integrated spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic effects To provide sub-pixel resolution the PRF is represented as a piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh This continuous representation allows the prediction of a star&#39;s flux value on any pixel given the star&#39;s pixel position
The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial representation are discussed including characterization of spatial variation in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial patches On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler field of view are described Two uses of the PRF are presented the selection of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratio for that star
CONTEXT Most current radial velocity planet search programs have concentrated on stars of one solar mass Our knowledge on the frequency of giant planets and brown dwarf companions to more massive stars is thus rather limited In the case of solar-like stars the frequency of short-period brown dwarf companions and very massive planets seems to be low
AIMS Here we present evidence for a substellar companion to 30 Ari B an F-star of 1 16 $\pm$ 0 04 $\rm M_\odot$ that is a member of a hierarchical triple system METHODS The companion was detected by means of precise radial velocity measurements using the 2-m Alfred-Jensch telescope and its &#39;echelle spectrograph
An iodine absorption cell provided the wavelength reference for precise stellar radial velocity measurements RESULTS We analyzed our radial velocity measurements and derived an orbit to the companion with period P= 335 1+/-2 5 days eccentricity e = 0 289+/-0 092 and mass function f(m) = (6 1+/-1 7)*10E-7 Modot
CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the radial velocity variations of 30 Ari B are due to a companion with $m$ sin $i$ of $9 88\pm0 94$ $\rm M_{Jup}$ that is either a massive planet or a brown dwarf {The object thus belongs to the rare class of massive planets and brown dwarfs orbiting main- sequence stars
Ten days of commissioning data (Quarter 0) and thirty-three days of science data (Quarter 1) yield instrumental flux timeseries of ~150 000 stars that were combed for transit events termed Threshold Crossing Events (TCE) each having a total detection statistic above 7 1-sigma TCE light curves are modeled as star+planet systems
Those returning a companion radius smaller than 2R_J are assigned a KOI (Kepler Object of Interest) number The raw flux pixel flux and flux-weighted centroids of every KOI are scrutinized to assess the likelihood of being an astrophysical false-positive versus the likelihood of a being a planetary companion This vetting using Kepler data is referred to as data validation
Herein we describe the data validation metrics and graphics used to identify viable planet candidates amongst the KOIs Light curve modeling tests for a) the difference in depth of the odd- versus even-numbered transits b) evidence of ellipsoidal variations and c) evidence of a secondary eclipse event at phase=0 5
Flux-weighted centroids are used to test for signals correlated with transit events with a magnitude and direction indicative of a background eclipsing binary Centroid timeseries are complimented by analysis of images taken in-transit versus out-of-transit the difference often revealing the pixel contributing the most to the flux change during transit
We obtain analytical expressions for the velocity anomaly due to the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect for the case when the anomalous radial velocity is obtained by cross-correlation with a stellar template spectrum In the limit of vanishing width of the stellar absorption lines our result reduces to the formula derived by Ohta et al
(2005) which is based on the first moment of distorted stellar lines Our new formula contains a term dependent on the stellar linewidth which becomes important when rotational line broadening is appreciable We generate mock transit spectra for four existing exoplanetary systems (HD17156 TrES-2 TrES- 4 and HD209458) following the procedure of Winn et al
(2005) and find that the new formula is in better agreement with the velocity anomaly extracted from the mock data Thus our result provides a more reliable analytical description of the velocity anomaly due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and explains the previously observed dependence of the velocity anomaly on the stellar rotation velocity
Kuiper belt object 136108 Haumea is one of the most fascinating bodies in our solar system Approximately 2000x1600x1000 km in size it is one of the largest Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and an unusually elongated one for its size The shape of Haumea is the result of rotational deformation due to its extremely short 3
Unlike other 1000 km-scale KBOs which are coated in methane ice the surface of Haumea is covered in almost pure water-ice The bulk density of Haumea estimated around 2 6 g/cc suggests a more rocky interior composition different from the water-ice surface Recently Haumea has become the second KBO after Pluto to show observable signs of surface features
We have investigated the effect of rotation on the polarization of scattered light for the near-Earth asteroid (1943) Anteros using the Dual Beam Imaging Polarimeter on the University of Hawaii&#39;s 2 2 m telescope Anteros is an L-type asteroid that has not been previously observed polarimetrically We find weak but significant variations in the polarization of Anteros as a function of rotation
Moderately close binaries are a special class of targets for planet searches <br>From a theoretical standpoint their hospitality to giant planets is uncertain and debated From an observational standpoint many of these systems present technical difficulties for precise radial-velocity measurements and classical Doppler surveys avoid them accordingly In spite of these adverse factors
present data support the idea that giant planets residing in binary and hierarchical systems provide unique observational constraints on the processes of planet formation and evolution The interest and the importance of including various types of binary stars in extrasolar planet studies have thus grown over time and significant efforts have recently been put into
(i) searching for stellar companions to the known planet-host stars using direct imaging and (ii) extending Doppler planet searches to spectroscopic and moderately close visual binaries In this contribution we review the observational progresses made over the past years to detect and study extrasolar planets in binary systems putting special emphasis on the two developments mentioned above
Kepler&#39;s primary mission is a search for earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zone of late-type stars using the transit method To effectively accomplish this mission Kepler orbits the Sun and stares nearly continuously at one field-of-view which was carefully selected to provide an appropriate density of target stars The data transmission rates
operational cycles and target management requirements implied by this mission design have been optimized and integrated into a comprehensive plan for science operations The commissioning phase completed all critical tasks and accomplished all objectives within a week of the pre-launch plan Since starting science the nominal data collection timeline has been interrupted by two safemode events
several losses of fine point and some small pointing adjustments The most important anomalies are understood and mitigated so Kepler&#39;s technical performance metrics have improved significantly over this period and the prognosis for mission success is excellent The Kepler data archive is established and hosting data for the science team
The growth processes from protoplanetary dust to planetesimals are not fully understood Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking bouncing and fragmentation However no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing
We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses their porosities and the collision velocity With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment
We use literature data perform own laboratory experiments and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates In our study we found four different types of sticking two types of bouncing and three types of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates
We distinguish between eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio For each of these cases we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10^-12 and 10^2 g and collision velocities in the range 10^-4 to 10^4 cm/s for arbitrary porosities This model comprises the collisional outcome the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities
Three-dimensional numerical simulations show that large-scale latent heating resulting from condensation of water vapor can produce multiple zonal jets similar to those on the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) For plausible water abundances (3-5 times solar on Jupiter/Saturn and 30 times solar on Uranus/Neptune)
our simulations produce ~20 zonal jets for Jupiter and Saturn and 3 zonal jets on Uranus and Neptune similar to the number of jets observed on these planets Moreover these Jupiter/Saturn cases produce equatorial superrotation whereas the Uranus/Neptune cases produce equatorial subrotation consistent with the observed equatorial jet direction on these <a href="http
//planets Sensitivity" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> tests show that water abundance planetary rotation rate and planetary radius are all controlling factors with water playing the most important role; modest water abundances large planetary radii and fast rotation rates favor equatorial superrotation whereas large water abundances favor equatorial subrotation regardless of the planetary radius and rotation rate
Given the larger radii faster rotation rates and probable lower water abundances of Jupiter and Saturn relative to Uranus and Neptune our simulations therefore provide a possible mechanism for the existence of equatorial superrotation on Jupiter and Saturn and the lack of superrotation on Uranus and Neptune Nevertheless Saturn poses a possible difficulty
as our simulations were unable to explain the unusually high speed (~400m/s) of that planet&#39;s superrotating jet The zonal jets in our simulations exhibit modest violations of the barotropic and Charney-Stern stability criteria Overall our simulations while idealized support the idea that latent heating plays an important role in generating the jets on the giant planets
No terrestrial planet formation simulation completed to date has considered the detailed chemical composition of the planets produced While many have considered possible water contents and late veneer compositions none have examined the bulk elemental abundances of the planets produced as an important check of formation models Here we report on the first study of this type
Bulk elemental abundances based on disk equilibrium studies have been determined for the simulated terrestrial planets of O&#39;Brien et al (2006) These abundances are in excellent agreement with observed planetary values indicating that the models of O&#39;Brien et al (2006) are successfully producing planets comparable to those of the Solar System in terms of both their dynamical and chemical properties
Significant amounts of water are accreted in the present simulations implying that the terrestrial planets form &#34;wet&#34; and do not need significant water delivery from other sources Under the assumption of equilibrium controlled chemistry the biogenic species N and C still need to be delivered to the Earth as they are not accreted in significant proportions during the formation process
The Kepler Mission seeks to detect Earth-size planets transiting solar-like stars in its ~115 deg^2 field of view over the course of its 3 5 year primary mission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156 000 Long Cadence stellar targets with a time resolution of 29 4 minutes We discuss the photometric precision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for data obtained in the 33
The lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at various timescales is consistent with expected random noise sources indicating that Kepler has the capability to fulfill its mission The Kepler light curves exhibit high precision over a large dynamic range which will surely permit their use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding and characterizing planets
The Kepler Mission relies on precise differential photometry to detect the 80 parts per million (ppm) signal from an Earth-Sun equivalent transit Such precision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days and systematic error removal to better than 20 ppm To this end the spacecraft and photometer underwent 67 days of commissioning
which included several data sets taken to characterize the photometer performance Because Kepler has no shutter we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection from which we measured the bias levels dark current and read noise These basic detector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests
indicating that the photometer is working as expected Several image artifacts have proven more complex than when observed during ground testing as a result of their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability in flight which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on the timescales of transits Because of Kepler&#39;s unprecedented sensitivity and stability
we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affect photometric precision We are using the first 43 days of science data to characterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods that will be implemented in the calibration pipeline Based on early testing we expect to attain Kepler&#39;s planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of the field of view
We use resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the nested grid technique to study the formation of protoplanetary disks around protostars from molecular cloud cores that provide the realistic environments for planet formation We find that gaseous planetary-mass objects are formed in the early evolutionary phase by gravitational instability in regions that are decoupled from the magnetic field and surrounded by the injection points of the magnetohydrodynamical outflows during the formation phase of protoplanetary disks
Magnetic decoupling enables massive disks to form and these are subject to gravitational instability even at ~ 10 AU The frequent formation of planetary-mass objects in the disk suggests the possibility of constructing a hybrid planet formation scenario where the rocky planets form later under the influence of the giant planets in the protoplanetary disk
Correct distributions of extrasolar systems for their orbital parameters (semi-major axes period eccentricity) and physical characteristics (mass spectral type of parent star) are received Orbital resonances in extrasolar systems are considered It is shown that the account of more thin effects including with use of wavelet methods in obviously incorrectly reduced distributions it is not justified
Porosity evolution of dust aggregates is crucial in understanding dust evolution in protoplanetary disks In this study we present useful tools to study the coagulation and porosity evolution of dust aggregates First we present a new numerical method for simulating dust coagulation and porosity evolution as an extension of the conventional Smoluchowski equation
This method follows the evolution of the mean porosity for each aggregate mass simultaneously with the evolution of the mass distribution function This method reproduces the results of previous Monte Carlo simulations with much less computational expense Second we propose a new collision model for porous dust aggregates on the basis of our N-body experiments on aggregate collisions
We first obtain empirical data on porosity changes between the classical limits of ballistic cluster-cluster and particle-cluster aggregation Using the data we construct a recipe for the porosity change due to general hit-and-stick collisions as well as formulae for the aerodynamical and collisional cross sections Simple coagulation simulations using the extended Smoluchowski method show that our collision model explains the fractal dimensions of porous aggregates observed in a full N-body simulation and a laboratory experiment
The dynamical interactions that occur in newly formed planetary systems may reflect the conditions occurring in the protoplanetary disk out of which they formed With this in mind we explore the attainment and maintenance of orbital resonances by migrating planets in the terrestrial mass range Migration time scales varying between millions of years and thousands of years are considered
In the former case for which the migration time is comparable to the lifetime of the protoplanetary gas disk a 2 1 resonance may be formed In the latter relatively rapid migration regime commensurabilities of high degree such as 8 7 or 11 10 may be formed However in any one large-scale migration several different commensurabilities may be formed sequentially
each being associated with significant orbital evolution We also use a simple analytic theory to develop conditions for first order commensurabilities to be formed These depend on the degree of the commensurability the imposed migration and circularization rates and the planet mass ratios These conditions are found to be consistent with the results of our simulations
The radii of some transiting extrasolar giant planets are larger than would be expected by the standard theory We address this puzzle with the model of coupled radius-orbit tidal evolution developed by \citet{Ibgui_and_Burrows_2009} The planetary radius is evolved self-consistently with orbital parameters under the influence of tidal torques and tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet
A general feature of this model which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case is that a possible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt its standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we observe In particular a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still be inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating
We have modified our model to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor in the star $Q&#39;_{\ast} \propto P^{\gamma}$ $-1 \leqslant \gamma \leqslant 1$ With this model we search for a tidally heated planet orbital and radius evolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius
the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated age range We find that for some inflated planets (WASP-6b and WASP-15b) there are such tracks; for another (TrES-4) there are none; and for still others (WASP-4b and WASP-12b) there are such tracks but our model might imply that we are observing the planets at a special time
We have developed a homogeneous model of physical chemistry to investigate the neutral-dominated water-based Enceladus torus Electrons are treated as the summation of two isotropic Maxwellian distributions$-$a thermal component and a hot component The effects of electron impact electron recombination charge exchange and photochemistry are included The mass source is neutral H$_2$O
and a rigidly-corotating magnetosphere introduces energy via pickup of freshly-ionized neutrals A small fraction of energy is also input by Coulomb collisions with a small population ($&lt;$ 1%) of supra-thermal electrons Mass and energy are lost due to radial diffusion escaping fast neutrals produced by charge exchange and recombination and a small amount of radiative cooling
We explore a constrained parameter space spanned by water source rate ion radial diffusion hot-electron temperature and hot-electron density The key findings are (1) radial transport must take longer than 12 days; (2) water is input at a rate of 100--180 kg s$^{-1}$; (3) hot electrons have energies between 100 and 250 eV; (4) neutrals dominate ions by a ratio of 40
The detailed study of the exoplanetary systems HD189733 and HD209458 has given rise to a wealth of exciting information on the physics of exoplanetary atmospheres To further our understanding of the make-up and processes within these atmospheres we require a larger sample of bright transiting planets We have began a project to detect more bright transiting planets in the southern hemisphere by utilising precision radial-velocity measurements
We have observed a constrained sample of bright inactive and metal-rich stars using the HARPS instrument and here we present the current status of this project along with our first discoveries which include a brown dwarf/extreme-Jovian exoplanet found in the brown dwarf desert region around the star HD191760 and improved orbits for three other exoplanetary systems HD48265
We present new radial velocity measurements of the ultra-cool dwarf VB 10 which was recently announced to host a giant planet detected with astrometry The new observations were obtained using optical spectrographs(MIKE/Magellan and ESPaDOnS/CHFT) and cover a 63% of the reported period of 270 days We apply Least-squares periodograms to identify the most significant signals and evaluate their corresponding False Alarm Probabilities
We show that this method is the proper generalization to astrometric data because (1) it mitigates the coupling of the orbital parameters with the parallax and proper motion and (2) it permits a direct generalization to include non-linear Keplerian parameters in a combined fit to astrometry and radial velocity data
In fact our analysis of the astrometry alone uncovers the reported 270 d period and an even stronger signal at 50 days We estimate the uncertainties in the parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach The nominal precision of the new Doppler measurements is about 150 s$^{-1}$ while their standard deviation is 250 ms$^{-1}$
However the best fit solutions still have RMS of 200 ms$^{-1}$ indicating that the excess in variability is due to uncontrolled systematic errors rather than the candidate companions detected in the astrometry Although the new data alone cannot rule-out the presence of a candidate when combined with published radial velocity measurements
Chauvin et al 2005 imaged a co-moving companion at ~260 AU from the young star AB Pic A Evolutionary models predictions based on J H K photometry of AB Pic b suggested a mass of ~13 - 14 MJup placing the object at the deuterium-burning boundary We used the adaptive-optics-fed integral field spectrograph SINFONI to obtain high quality medium-resolution spectra of AB Pic b (R = 1500-2000) over the 1
Our analysis relies on the comparison of our spectra to young standard templates and to the latest libraries of synthetic spectra developed by the Lyon&#39;s Group AB Pic b is confirmed to be a young early-L dwarf companion We derive a spectral type L0-L1 and find several features indicative of intermediate gravity atmosphere
A comparison to synthetic spectra yields Teff = 2000+100-300 K and log(g) = 4 +- 0 5 dex The determination of the derived atmospheric parameters of AB Pic b is limited by a non-perfect match of current atmosphere spectra with our near-infrared observations of AB Pic b The current treatment of dust settling and missing molecular opacity lines in the atmosphere models could be responsible
By combining the observed photometry the surface fluxes from atmosphere models and the known distance of the system we derive new mass luminosity and radius estimates of AB Pic b They confirm independently the evolutionary model predictions We finally review the current methods used to characterize planetary mass companions and discuss them in the perspective of future planet deep imaging surveys
The formation mechanism of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs is hotly debated Currently the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized objects within a turbulent disc followed by a phase of gravitational instability At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as opposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real protoplanetary disc
Therefore single particles are often used as super-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles It is assumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions are not modeled The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a collisionless or strongly collisional system however in many recent numerical simulations this is not the case
<br>In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of planetesimal formation via gravitational instability A scaled system is studied that does not require the use of super-particles We find that the scaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the properties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important timescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real protoplanetary disc
Constraints are given for the number of particles needed in order to achieve numerical convergence <br>We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach We find that the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on artifacts such as the gravitational softening in both the requirement for gravitational collapse and the resulting clump statistics
The Kepler Mission Science Operations Center (SOC) performs several critical functions including managing the ~156 000 target stars associated target tables science data compression tables and parameters as well as processing the raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month The raw data are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias
smear induced by a shutterless readout and other detector and electronic effects A background sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCD readout channels and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimal aperture for each star Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic information extracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in the flux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching for signatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based
adaptive matched filter Stars with signatures exceeding 7 1 sigma are subjected to a suite of statistical tests including an examination of each star&#39;s centroid motion to reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries Physical parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual light curve
The Hayabusa Spacecraft Asteroid Multiband Imaging Camera (AMICA) has acquired more than 1400 multispectral and high-resolution images of its target asteroid 25143 Itokawa since late August 2005 In this paper we summarize the design and performance of AMICA In addition we describe the calibration methods assumptions and models based on measurements
Major calibration steps include corrections for linearity and modeling and subtraction of bias dark current read-out smear and pixel-to-pixel responsivity variations AMICA v-band data were calibrated to radiance using in-flight stellar observations The other band data were calibrated to reflectance by comparing them to ground-based observations to avoid the uncertainty of the solar irradiation in those bands
We found that the AMICA signal was linear with respect to the input signal to an accuracy of &lt;&lt; 1% when the signal level was &lt; 3800 DN We verified that the absolute radiance calibration of the AMICA v-band (0 55 micron) was accurate to 4% or less the accuracy of the disk-integrated spectra with respect to the AMICA v-band was about 1%
and the pixel-to-pixel responsivity (flatfield) variation was 3% or less The uncertainty in background zero-level was 5 DN From wide-band observations of star clusters we found that the AMICA optics have an effective focal length of 120 80 \pm 0 03 mm yielding a field-of-view (FOV) of 5 83 deg x 5
The resulting geometric distortion model was accurate to within a third of a pixel We demonstrated an image-restoration technique using the point-spread functions of stars and confirmed that the technique functions well in all loss-less images An artifact not corrected by this calibration is scattered light associated with bright disks in the FOV
We analyze a vast light curve database by obtaining mean rotational properties of the entire sample determining the spin frequency distribution and comparing those data with a simple model based on hydrostatic equilibrium For the rotation periods the mean value obtained is 6 95 h for the whole sample 6
From Maxwellian fits to the rotational frequencies distribution the mean rotation rates are 7 35 h for the entire sample 7 71 h for the TNOs alone and 8 95 h for the Centaurs These results are obtained by taking into account the criteria of considering a single-peak light curve for objects with amplitudes lower than 0
The best Maxwellian fits were obtained with the threshold between 0 10 and 0 15mag The mean light-curve amplitude for the entire sample is 0 26 mag 0 25mag for TNOs only and 0 26mag for the Centaurs The amplitude versus Hv correlation clearly indicates that the smaller (and collisionally evolved) objects are more elongated than the bigger ones
From the model results it appears that hydrostatic equilibrium can explain the statistical results of almost the entire sample which means hydrostatic equilibrium is probably reached by almost all TNOs in the H range [-1 7] This implies that for plausible albedos of 0 04 to 0 20 objects with diameters from 300km to even 100km would likely be in equilibrium
We show that the gas giant exoplanet HD 189733b is less oblate than Saturn based on Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of seven transits The observable manifestations of oblatenesswould have been slight anomalies during the ingress and egress phases as well as variations in the transit depth due to spin precession
Our nondetection of these effects gives the first empirical constraints on the shape of an exoplanet The results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the planetary rotation period and orbital period are synchronized in which case the oblateness would be an order of magnitude smaller than our upper limits
Conversely if HD 189733b is assumed to be in a synchronous zero-obliquity state then the data give an upper bound on the quadrupole moment of the planet (J2 &lt; 0 068 with 95% confidence) that is too weak to constrain the interior structure of the planet An Appendix describes a fast algorithm for computing the transit light curve of an oblate planet
The primary aim of this work is to examine the effect of parabolic stellar encounters on the evolution of a Jovian-mass giant planet forming within a protoplanetary disc We consider the effect on both the mass accretion and the migration history as a function of encounter distance We use a grid-based hydrodynamics code to perform 2D simulations of a system consisting of a giant planet embedded within a gaseous disc orbiting around a star
which is perturbed by a passing star on a prograde parabolic orbit The disc model extends out to 50 AU and parabolic encounters are considered with impact parameters ranging from 100 - 250 AU In agreement with previous work we find that the disc is significantly tidally truncated for encounters &lt; 150 AU
and the removal of angular momentum from the disc by the passing star causes a substantial inflow of gas through the disc The gap formed by the embedded planet becomes flooded with gas causing the gas accretion rate onto the planet to increase abruptly Gas flow through the gap and into the inner disc
causes the positive inner disc torques exerted on the planet to increase resulting in a sustained period of outward migration For weaker interactions corresponding to an encounter distance of &gt; 250 AU we find that the planet-disc system experiences minimal perturbation Our results indicate that stellar fly-bys in young clusters may significantly modify the masses and orbital parameters of giant planets forming within protostellar discs
We present Keck/HIRES data with model atmosphere analysis of the helium-dominated polluted white dwarf GD 40 in which we measure atmospheric abundances relative to helium of 9 elements H O Mg Si Ca Ti Cr Mn and Fe Apart from hydrogen whose association with the other contaminants is uncertain this material most likely accreted from GD 40&#39;s circumstellar dust disk whose existence is demonstrated by excess infrared emission
The data are best explained by accretion of rocky planetary material in which heavy elements are largely contained within oxides derived from a tidally disrupted minor planet at least the mass of Juno and probably as massive as Vesta The relatively low hydrogen abundance sets an upper limit of 10% water by mass in the inferred parent body
and the relatively high abundances of refractory elements Ca and Ti may indicate high-temperature processing While the overall constitution of the parent body is similar to the bulk Earth being over 85% by mass composed of oxygen magnesium silicon and iron we find n(Si)/n(Mg) = 0 30 +/- 0 11
We discuss our current understanding of the interior structure and thermal evolution of giant planets This includes the gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium as well as the &#34;ice giants &#34; such as Uranus and Neptune which are primarily composed of elements heavier than H/He
The effect of different hydrogen equations of state (including new first-principles computations) on Jupiter&#39;s core mass and heavy element distribution is detailed This variety of the hydrogen equations of state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter&#39;s core mass of 18 M_Earth For Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0
perhaps indicating the existence of an eroded core as also supported by their low luminosity We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar system&#39;s planets and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be necessary to understand their cooling history We review how measurements of the masses and radii of the ~50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are changing our understanding of giant planets
To explain important properties of extrasolar planetary systems (eg close-in hot Jupiters resonant planets) an evolutionary scenario which allows for radial migration of planets in disks is required During their formation protoplanets undergo a phase in which they are embedded in the disk and interact gravitationally with it This planet-disk interaction results in torques (through gravitational forces) acting on the planet that will change its angular momentum and result in a radial migration of the planet through the disk
To determine the outcome of this very important process for planet formation dedicated high resolution numerical modeling is required This contribution focusses on some important aspects of the numerical approach that we found essential for obtaining successful results We specifically mention the treatment of Coriolis forces Cartesian grids and the FARGO method
Polarimetry of extrasolar planets becomes a new tool for their investigation which requires the development of diagnostic techniques and parameter case studies Our goal is to develop a theoretical model which can be applied to interpret polarimetric observations of extrasolar planets Here we present a theoretical parameter study that shows the influence of the various involved parameters on the polarization curves
Furthermore we investigate the robustness of the fitting procedure We employ the physics of Rayleigh scattering to obtain polarization curves of an unresolved extrasolar planet Calculations are made for two cases (i) assuming an angular distribution for the intensity of the scattered light as from a Lambert sphere and for polarization as from a Rayleigh-type scatterer
and (ii) assuming that both the intensity and polarization of the scattered light are distributed according to the Rayleigh law We show that the difference between these two cases is negligible for the shapes of the polarization curves In addition we take the size of the host star into account
Two types of data sets for investigation of solar- modulated cycles in the climate of Bulgaria during the last ~ 200 years has been used in this study 1 Instrumental data for the rainfalls and temperatures in 26 stations during the period AD 1899-1994; A smoothing dendrochronological data series of the tree rings width of a beech sample (Fagus) for the period of AD 1780-1982
The data proceedings has been provided separately for the &#34;winter&#34; (November-April) and &#34;summer&#34; (May-October) half- years A well expressed quasi-20-22 and 54 yr cycles in the rains and temperature instrumental &#34;summer&#34; series as well as quasi 11yr cycle for the &#34;winter&#34; temeperature data has been established for the studied period 1899-1994
However there are also very serious variations of the 11 and 22 yr cycle magnitudes The quasi 20-22 yr (&#34;summer&#34;) cycle is weak expressed before AD 1930 while the 11 yr (winter) cycle is faded rapidly after ~AD 1975/76 The existence of 20-22 yr climatic cycle could be traced since the end of the supercenturial solar Dalton minimum (AD 1795-1830) in the beech tree ring width series
This note suggests that near earth objects and Central Force Optimization have something in common that NEO theory may hold the key to solving some vexing problems in deterministic optimization local trapping and proof of convergence CFO analogizes Newton&#39;s laws to locate the global maxima of a function The NEO-CFO nexus is the striking similarity between CFO&#39;s Davg and an NEO&#39;s Delta-V curves
We present numerical simulations to model the production of observable long-period comets (LPCs) from the Oort Cloud a vast reservoir of icy bodies surrounding the Sun We show that inner Oort Cloud objects can penetrate Jupiter&#39;s orbit via a largely unexplored dynamical pathway and they are an important if not the dominant
source of known LPCs We use this LPC production to place observationally motivated constraints on the population and mass of the inner Oort Cloud which are consistent with giant planet formation theory These constraints indicate that only one comet shower producing late Eocene bombardment levels has likely occurred since the Cambrian Explosion
We develop an idealized dynamical model to predict the typical properties of outer extrasolar planetary systems at radii beyond 5 AU Our hypothesis is that dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a combination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an exterior disk of small bodies (&#34;planetesimals&#34;)
Using 5 000 long duration N-body simulations we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50 Earth mass primordial planetesimal disk For large planet masses (above that of Saturn) the influence of the disk is modest and we recover the observed eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller radii)
We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking strong correlations between planet masses in the same system For lower mass planets we observe diverse dynamical behavior strong scattering events sudden jumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings and re-circularization of scattered low-mass planets in the disk We present distributions of the final eccentricity and inclination
and discuss how they vary with planet mass and initial system architecture We predict a transition to lower eccentricities for low mass planets at radii where disks influence the dynamics Radial velocity measurements capable of detecting planets with K~5 m/s and periods in excess of 10 years will constrain this regime
We also study the population of resonant and non-resonant multiple planet systems We show that among systems with Jupiter-mass planets that avoid close encounters the planetesimal disk acts as a damping mechanism that frequently populates mean motion resonances Resonant chains ought to be common among massive planets in outer planetary systems
We present the results of a ground-based search for the secondary eclipse of the 3 3 Mjup transiting planet CoRoT-2b We performed near infrared photometry using the LIRIS instrument on the 4 2 m William Herschel Telescope in the H and K_s filters We monitored the star around two expected secondary eclipses in two nights under very good observing conditions
For the depth of the secondary eclipse we find in H-band a 3 sigma upper limit of 0 17% whereas we detected a tentative eclipse with a depth of 0 16+-0 09% in the K_s-band These depths can be translated into brightness temperatures of T_H&lt;2250 K and T_{K_s} = 1890(+260-350) K
Out of the known transiting extrasolar planets the majority are gas giants orbiting their host star at close proximity Both theoretical and observational studies support the hypothesis that such bodies emit significant amounts of flux relative to the host star increasing towards infrared wavelengths For the dayside of the exoplanet
this phenomenon typically permits detectable secondary eclipses at such wavelengths which may be used to infer atmospheric composition In this paper we explore the effects of emission from the nightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit lightcurve which is essentially a self-blend Allowing for nightside emission an exoplanet&#39;s transit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii
The nightside of an exoplanet is emitting flux and the contrast to the star&#39;s emission is of the order of ~10^(-3) for hot-Jupiters Consequently we show that the transit depth in the mid-infrared will be attenuated due to flux contribution from the nightside emission by ~10^(-4) We show how this effect can be compensated for in the case where exoplanet phase curves have been measured
in particular for HD 189733b For other systems it may be possible to make a first-order correction by using temperature estimates of the planet Unless the effect is accounted for transmission spectra will also be polluted by nightside emission and we estimate that a Spitzer broadband spectrum on a bright target is altered at the 1-sigma level
We detected the transit of HAT-P-6b at HJD 2454698 3908 +/- 0 0011 and that of WASP-1b at HJD 2454774 3448 +/- 0 0023 The updated orbital periods of the planets are 3 852992 +/- 0 000005 days (HAT-P-6b) and 2 519970 +/- 0 000003 days (WASP-1b) There is no indication of any departures from constant orbital period in these systems
CoRoT-7 b a planet about 70% larger than the Earth orbiting a Sun-like star is the first-discovered rocky exoplanet and hence has been dubbed a &#34;super-Earth&#34; Some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so close to its host star it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface
However these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system Even if the planet&#39;s eccentricity has always been zero we show that tidal decay of semi-major axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation
Moreover CoRoT-7 b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism In this case CoRoT-7 b is a &#34;super-Io&#34; that like Jupiter&#39;s volcanic moon is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10^-5 This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7 c if its own eccentricity is larger than ~10^-4
Many binary minor planets (BMPs; both binary asteroids and binary Trans-Neptunians objects; TNOs) are known to exist in the Solar system The currently observed orbital and physical properties of BMPs hold essential information and clues about their origin their evolution and the conditions underwhich they evolved Here we study the orbital properties of BMPs with currently known orbital solutions (the BMPs mutual orbits and not the BMP orbits around the sun)
We find that BMPs are typically highly inclined relative to their orbit around the sun with a distribution consistent with an isotropic distribution BMPs not affected by tidal forces are found to have high eccentricities with non-thermal eccentricity distribution peaking at intermediate eccentricities (typically 0 4-0 6) The high inclinations and eccentricities of the BMPs suggest that BMPs evolved in a dense collisional environment
Long-term precise Doppler measurements with the CORALIE spectrograph revealed the presence of two massive companions to the solar-type star HD202206 Although the three-body fit of the system is unstable it was shown that a 5 1 mean motion resonance exists close to the best fit where the system is stable
<br>We present here an extensive dynamical study of the HD202206 system aiming at constraining the inclinations of the two known companions from which we derive possible ranges of value for the companion masses <br>We study the long term stability of the system in a small neighborhood of the best fit using Laskar&#39;s frequency map analysis
We also introduce a numerical method based on frequency analysis to determine the center of libration mode inside a mean motion resonance <br>We find that acceptable coplanar configurations are limited to inclinations to the line of sight between 30 and 90 degrees This limits the masses of both companions to roughly twice the minimum
Non coplanar configurations are possible for a wide range of mutual inclinations from 0 to 90 degrees although $\Delta\Omega = 0 [\pi]$ configurations seem to be favored We also confirm the 5 1 mean motion resonance to be most likely In the coplanar edge-on case we provide a very good stable solution in the resonance
A number of Baker-Nunn Camera (BNC) were manufactured by Smithsonian Institution during the 60s as optical tracking systems for artificial satellites with optimal optical and mechanical specifications One of them was installed at the Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) <br>We have conducted a profound refurbishment project of the telescope to be installed at Observatori Astronòmic del Montsec (OAdM)
As a result the BNC offers the largest combination of a huge FOV (4 4$°$x4 4$°$) and aperture (leading to a limiting magnitude of V$\sim$20) <br>These specifications together with their remote and robotic natures allows this instrument to face an observational program of exoplanets detection by means of transit technique with high signal-to-noise ratio in the appropiate magnitude range
We present the discovery of a Neptune-mass planet OGLE-2007-BLG-368Lb with a planet-star mass ratio of q=[9 5 +/- 2 1] x 10^{-5} via gravitational microlensing The planetary deviation was detected in real-time thanks to the high cadence of the MOA survey real-time light curve monitoring and intensive follow-up observations A Bayesian analysis returns the stellar mass and distance at M_l = 0
respectively so the mass and separation of the planet are M_p = 20_{-8}^{+7} M_\oplus and a = 3 3_{-0 8}^{+1 4} AU respectively This discovery adds another cold Neptune-mass planet to the planetary sample discovered by microlensing which now comprise four cold Neptune/Super-Earths five gas giant planets and another sub-Saturn mass planet whose nature is unclear
The discovery of these ten cold exoplanets by the microlensing method implies that the mass ratio function of cold exoplanets scales as dN_{\rm pl}/d\log q \propto q^{-0 7 +/- 0 2} with a 95% confidence level upper limit of n &lt; -0 35 (where dN_{\rm pl}/d\log q \propto q^n) As microlensing is most sensitive to planets beyond the snow-line
Hundreds of radar-dark patches interpreted as lakes have been discovered in the north and south polar regions of Titan We have estimated the composition of these lakes by using the direct abundance measurements from the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) aboard the Huygens probe and recent photochemical models based on the vertical temperature profile derived by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI)
Thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed between the atmosphere and the lakes which are also considered as nonideal solutions We find that the main constituents of the lakes are ethane (C2H6) (~76-79%) propane (C3H8) (~7-8%) methane (CH4) (~5-10%) hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (~2-3%) butene (C4H8) (~1%) butane (C4H10) (~1%) and acetylene (C2H2) (~1%)
The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method relies on monitoring changes in timing of transits of known exoplanets Non-transiting planets in the system can be inferred from TTVs by their gravitational interaction with the transiting planet The TTV method is sensitive to low-mass planets that cannot be detected by other means
Here we describe a fast algorithm that can be used to determine the mass and orbit of the non-transiting planets from the TTV data We apply our code ttvim f to a wide variety of planetary systems to test the uniqueness of the TTV inversion problem and its dependence on the precision of TTV observations
It is known since the seminal study of Laskar (1989) that the inner planetary system is chaotic with respect to its orbits and even escapes are not impossible although in time scales of billions of years The aim of this investigation is to locate the orbits of Venus and Earth in phase space
respectively to see how close their orbits are to chaotic motion which would lead to unstable orbits for the inner planets on much shorter time scales Therefore we did numerical experiments in different dynamical models with different initial conditions -- on one hand the couple Venus-Earth was set close to different mean motion resonances (MMR)
and on the other hand Venus&#39; orbital eccentricity (or inclination) was set to values as large as e = 0 36 (i = 40deg) The couple Venus-Earth is almost exactly in the 13 8 mean motion resonance The stronger acting 8 5 MMR inside and the 5 3 MMR outside the 13
The origin of Earth oceans is controversial Earth could have acquired its water either from hydrated silicates (wet Earth scenario) or from comets (dry Earth scenario) [HDO]/[H2O] ratios are used to discriminate between the scenarios High [HDO]/[H2O] ratios are found in Earth oceans These high ratios are often attributed to the release of deuterium enriched cometary water ice
which was formed at low gas and dust temperatures Observations do not show high [HDO]/[H2O] in interstellar ices We investigate the possible formation of high [HDO]/[H2O] ratios in dense (nH&gt; 1E6 cm^{-3}) and warm gas (T=100-1000 K) by gas-phase photochemistry in the absence of grain surface chemistry We derive analytical solutions
taking into account the major neutral-neutral reactions for gases at T&gt;100 K The chemical network is dominated by photodissociation and neutral-neutral reactions Despite the high gas temperature deuterium fractionation occurs because of the difference in activation energy between deuteration enrichment and the back reactions The analytical solutions were confirmed by the time-dependent chemical results in a 1E-3 MSun disc around a typical TTauri star using the photochemical code ProDiMo
The ProDiMo code includes frequency-dependent 2D dust-continuum radiative transfer detailed non-LTE gas heating and cooling and hydrostatic calculation of the disc structure Both analytical and time-dependent models predict high [HDO]/[H2O] ratios in the terrestrial planet forming region (&lt; 3 AU) of circumstellar discs Therefore the [HDO]/[H2O] ratio may not be an unique criterion to discriminate between the different origins of water on Earth
We compute that extrasolar minor planets can retain much of their internal H_2O during their host star&#39;s red giant evolution The eventual accretion of a water-rich body or bodies onto a helium white dwarf might supply an observable amount of atmospheric hydrogen as seems likely for GD 362 More generally
if hydrogen pollution in helium white dwarfs typically results from accretion of large parent bodies rather than interstellar gas as previously supposed then H_2O probably constitutes at least 10% of the aggregate mass of extrasolar minor planets One observational test of this possibility is to examine the atmospheres of externally-polluted white dwarfs for oxygen in excess of that likely contributed by oxides such as SiO_2
The relatively high oxygen abundance previously reported in GD 378 plausibly but not uniquely can be explained by accretion of an H_2O-rich parent body or bodies Future ultraviolet observations of white dwarf pollutions can serve to investigate the hypothesis that environments with liquid water that are suitable habitats for extremophiles are widespread in the Milky Way
The origin of the high inclination of Uranus&#39; spin-axis (Uranus&#39; obliquity) is one of the great unanswered questions about the Solar system Giant planets are believed to form with nearly zero obliquity and it has been shown that the present behaviour of Uranus&#39; spin is essentially stable Several attempts were made in order to solve this problem
Here we report numerical simulations showing that Uranus&#39; axis can be tilted during the planetary migration without the need of a giant impact provided that the planet had an additional satellite and a temporary large inclination This might have happened during the giant planet instability phase described in the Nice model
Relatively small amounts (typically between 2-200 parts per million) of presolar grains have been preserved in the matrices of chondritic meteorites The measured abundances of the different types of grains are highly variable from one chondrite to another but are higher in unequilibrated chondrites that have experienced little or no aqueous alteration and/or metamorphic heating than in processed meteorites
A general overview of the abundances measured in presolar grains (particularly the recently identified presolar silicates) contained in primitive chondrites is presented Here we will focus on the most primitive chondrite groups as typically the highest measured abundances of presolar grains occur in primitive chondrites that have experienced little thermal metamorphism
Looking at the most aqueously altered chondrite groups we find a clear pattern of decreasing abundance of presolar silicate grains with increasing level of aqueous alteration We conclude that the measured abundances of presolar grains in altered chondrites are strongly biased by their peculiar histories Scales quantifying the intensity of aqueous alteration and shock metamorphism in chondrites could correlate with the content in presolar silicates
To do this it would be required to infer the degree of destruction or homogenization of presolar grains in the matrices of primitive meteorites To get an unbiased picture of the relative abundance of presolar grains in the different regions of the protoplanetary disk where first meteorites consolidated future dedicated studies of primitive meteorites
We present an analysis of ~5 years of Lick Observatory radial velocity measurements targeting a uniform sample of 31 intermediate-mass subgiants (1 5 &lt; M*/Msun &lt; 2 0) with the goal of measuring the occurrence rate of Jovian planets around (evolved) A-type stars and comparing the distributions of their orbital and physical characteristics to those of planets around Sun-like stars
We provide updated orbital solutions incorporating new radial velocity measurements for five known planet-hosting stars in our sample; uncertainties in the fitted parameters are assessed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method The frequency of Jovian planets interior to 3 AU is 26 (+9 -8)% which is significantly higher than the ~5-10% frequency observed around solar-mass stars
The median detection threshold for our sample includes minimum masses down to {0 2 0 3 0 5 0 6 1 3} MJup within {0 1 0 3 0 6 1 0 3 0} AU To compare the properties of planets around intermediate-mass stars to those around solar-mass stars we synthesize a population of planets based on the parametric relationship dN ~ M^{alpha}P^{beta} dlnM dlnP
the observed planet frequency and the detection limits we derived We find that the values of alpha and beta for planets around solar-type stars from Cumming et al fail to reproduce the observed properties of planets in our sample at the 4 sigma level even when accounting for the different planet occurrence rates
The astrometry technique is an important tool for detecting and characterizing exoplanets of different type In this review the different projects which are either operating in construction or in discussion are presented and their performance discussed in the framework of the Blue Dots study We investigate the sensitivity of astrometry to different sources of noise and we show that astrometry is a key technique in the path of discovering and characterizing new types of planets including the very challenging category of Earth-like planets orbiting the habitable zone of solar-type stars
Stellar perturbations affect planet-formation in binary systems Recent studies show that the planet-formation stage of mutual accretion of km-sized planetesimals is most sensitive to binary effects In this paper the condition for planetesimal accretion is investigated around Alpha CenB which is believed to be an ideal candidate for detection of an Earth-like planet in or near its habitable zone(0
A simplified scaling method is developed to estimate the accretion timescale of the planetesimals embedded in a protoplanetary disk Twenty-four cases with different binary inclinations(i_B=0 0 1 1 0 and 10 deg) gas densities(0 3 1 and 3 times of the Minimum Mass of Solar Nebula MMSN hereafter) and with and without gas depletion
Dust is an important constituent in cometary comae; its analysis is one of the major objectives of ESA&#39;s Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (C-G) Several instruments aboard Rosetta are dedicated to studying various aspects of dust in the cometary coma all of which require a certain level of exposure to dust to achieve their goals
At the same time impacts of dust particles can constitute a hazard to the spacecraft To conciliate the demands of dust collection instruments and spacecraft safety it is desirable to assess the dust environment in the coma even before the arrival of Rosetta We describe the present status of modelling the dust coma of 67P/C-G and predict the speed and flux of dust in the coma
the dust fluence on a spacecraft along sample trajectories and the radiation environment in the coma The model will need to be refined when more details of the coma are revealed by observations An overview of astronomical observations of 67P/C-G is given and model parameters are derived from these data where possible
For quantities not yet measured for 67P/C-G we use values obtained for other comets One of the most important and most controversial parameters is the dust mass distribution We summarise the mass distribution functions derived from the in-situ measurements at comet 1P/Halley in 1986 For 67P/C-G constraining the mass distribution is currently only possible by the analysis of astronomical images
We present high-precision relative radial velocities of the very low-mass star VB10 that were obtained over a time span of 0 61 yr as part of an ongoing search for planets around stars at the end of the main sequence The radial velocities were measured from high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained using the CRIRES instrument on the VLT with an ammonia gas cell
The typical internal precision of the measurements is 10 m/s These data do not exhibit significant variability and are essentially constant at a level consistent with the measurement uncertainties Therefore we do not detect the radial velocity variations of VB10 expected due to the presence of an orbiting giant planet similar to that recently proposed by Pravdo and Shaklan based on apparent astrometric perturbations
In addition we do not confirm the ~1 km/s radial velocity variability of the star tentatively detected by Zapatero Osorio and colleagues with lower precision measurements Our measurements rule out planets with M_p &gt; 3 M_Jup and the orbital period and inclination suggested by Pravdo and Shaklan at better than 5 sigma confidence
The area of stable motion for fictitious Trojan asteroids around Uranus&#39; equilateral equilibrium points is investigated with respect to the inclination of the asteroid&#39;s orbit to determine the size of the regions and their shape For this task we used the results of extensive numerical integrations of orbits for a grid of initial conditions around the points L4 and L5
and analyzed the stability of the individual orbits Our basic dynamical model was the Outer Solar System (Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune) We integrated the equations of motion of fictitious Trojans in the vicinity of the stable equilibrium points for selected orbits up to the age of the Solar system of 5 billion years
One experiment has been undertaken for cuts through the Lagrange points for fixed values of the inclinations while the semimajor axes were varied The extension of the stable region with respect to the initial semimajor axis lies between 19 05 &lt; a &lt; 19 3 AU but depends on the initial inclination
In another run the inclination of the asteroids&#39; orbit was varied in the range 0 &lt; i &lt; 60 and the semimajor axes were fixed It turned out that only four &#39;windows&#39; of stable orbits survive these are the orbits for the initial inclinations 0 &lt; i &lt; 7 9 &lt; i &lt; 13
Transiting planet systems offer an unique opportunity to observationally constrain proposed models of the interiors (radius composition) and atmospheres (chemistry dynamics) of extrasolar planets The spectacular successes of ground-based transit surveys (more than 60 transiting systems known to-date) and the host of multi-wavelength spectro-photometric follow-up studies carried out in particular by HST and Spitzer
have paved the way to the next generation of transit search projects which are currently ongoing (CoRoT Kepler) or planned The possibility of detecting and characterizing transiting Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars appears tantalizingly close In this contribution we briefly review the power of the transit technique for characterization of extrasolar planets
A number of substellar companions to evolved cool stars have now been reported Cool giants are distinct from their progenitor Main Sequence (MS) low-mass stars in a number of ways First the mass loss rates of cool giant stars are orders of magnitude greater than for the late-type MS stars
Second on the cool side of the Linsky-Haisch &#34;dividing line&#34; K and M giant stars are not X-ray sources although they do show evidence for chromospheres As a result cool star winds are largely neutral for those spectral types suggesting that planetary or brown dwarf magnetospheres will not be effective in standing off the stellar wind
Whether binaries can harbor potentially habitable planets depends on several factors including the physical properties and the orbital characteristics of the binary system While the former determines the location of the habitable zone (HZ) the latter affects the dynamics of the material from which terrestrial planets are formed (i e
planetesimals and planetary embryos) and drives the final architecture of the planets assembly In order for a habitable planet to form in a binary star system these two factors have to work in harmony That is the orbital dynamics of the two stars and their interactions with the planet-forming material have to allow terrestrial planet formation in the habitable zone
and ensure that the orbit of a potentially habitable planet will be stable for long times We have organized this chapter with the same order in mind We begin by presenting a general discussion on the motion of planets in binary stars and their stability We then discuss the stability of terrestrial planets
Multiple impact basins formed on the Moon about 3 8 Gyr ago in what is known as the lunar cataclysm or late heavy bombardment Many workers currently interpret the lunar cataclysm as an impact spike primarily caused by main-belt asteroids destabilized by delayed planetary migration We show that morphologically fresh (class 1) craters on the lunar highlands were mostly formed during the brief tail of the cataclysm
as they have absolute crater number density similar to that of the Orientale basin and ejecta blanket The connection between class 1 craters and the cataclysm is supported by the similarity of their size-frequency distribution to that of stratigraphically-identified Imbrian craters Majority of lunar craters younger than the Imbrium basin (including class 1 craters) thus record the size-frequency distribution of the lunar cataclysm impactors
The SIM Lite mission will undertake several planet surveys One of them the Deep Planet Survey is designed to detect Earth-mass exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby main sequence stars A double blind study has been conducted to assess the capability of SIM to detect such small planets in a multi-planet system where several giant planets might be present
One of the tools which helped in deciding if the detected planets were actual was an orbit integrator using the publicly available HNBody code so that the orbit solutions could be analyzed in terms of temporal stability over many orbits In this contribution we describe the implementation of this integrator and analyze the different blind test solutions
The size distribution and total mass of objects in the Oort Cloud have important implications to the theory of planets formation including the properties of and the processes taking place in the early solar system We discuss the potential of space missions like Kepler and CoRoT designed to discover transiting exo-planets
to detect Oort Cloud Kuiper Belt and main belt objects by occultations of background stars Relying on published dynamical estimates of the content of the Oort Cloud we find that Kepler&#39;s main program is expected to detect between 0 and ~100 occultation events by deca-kilometer-sized Oort Cloud objects The occultations rate depends on the mass of the Oort cloud
the distance to its &#34;inner edge&#34; and the size distribution of its objects In contrast Kepler is unlikely to find occultations by Kuiper Belt or main belt asteroids mainly due to the fact that it is observing a high ecliptic latitude field Occultations by Solar System objects will appear as a photometric deviation in a single measurement
implying that the information regarding the time scale and light-curve shape of each event is lost We present statistical methods that have the potential to verify the authenticity of occultation events by Solar System objects to estimate the distance to the occulting population and to constrain their size distribution Our results are useful for planning of future space-based exo-planet searches in a way that will maximize the probability of detecting solar system objects
We report Spitzer/IRAC photometry of the transiting giant exoplanet HAT-P-1b during its secondary eclipse This planet lies near the postulated boundary between the pM and pL-class of hot Jupiters and is important as a test of models for temperature inversions in hot Jupiter atmospheres We derive eclipse depths for HAT-P-1b
in units of the stellar flux that are 0 080% +/- 0 008% [3 6um] 0 135% +/- 0 022% [4 5um] 0 203% +/- 0 031% [5 8um] and $0 238% +/- 0 040% [8 0um] These values are best fit using an atmosphere with a modest temperature inversion
intermediate between the archetype inverted atmosphere (HD209458b) and a model without an inversion The observations also suggest that this planet is radiating a large fraction of the available stellar irradiance on its dayside with little available for redistribution by circulation This planet has sometimes been speculated to be inflated by tidal dissipation
based on its large radius in discovery observations and on a non-zero orbital eccentricity allowed by the radial velocity data The timing of the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to orbital eccentricity and we find that the central phase of the eclipse is 0 4999 +/- 0 0005 The difference between the expected and observed phase indicates that the orbit is close to circular
Using the NICMOS coronagraph we have obtained high-contrast 2 0 micron imaging polarimetry and 1 1 micron imaging of the circumstellar disk around AB Aurigae on angular scales of 0 3-3 arcsec (40-550 AU) Unlike previous observations these data resolve the disk in both total and polarized intensity allowing accurate measurement of the spatial variation of polarization fraction across the disk
Using these observations we investigate the apparent &#34;gap&#34; in the disk reported by Oppenheimer et al 2008 In polarized intensity the NICMOS data closely reproduces the morphology seen by Oppenheimer et al yet in total intensity we find no evidence for a gap in either our 1 1 or 2
We find instead that region has lower polarization fraction without a significant decrease in total scattered light consistent with expectations for back-scattered light on the far side of an inclined disk Radiative transfer models demonstrate this explanation fits the observations Geometrical scattering effects are entirely sufficient to explain the observed morphology without any need to invoke a gap or protoplanet at that location
We explore the biological damage initiated in the environments of F G K and M-type main-sequence stars due to photospheric chromospheric and flare radiation The amount of chromospheric radiation is in a statistical sense directly coupled to the stellar age as well as the presence of significant stellar magnetic fields and dynamo activity
With respect to photospheric radiation we also consider detailed synthetic models taking into account millions or hundred of millions of lines for atoms and molecules Chromospheric UV radiation is increased in young stars in regard to all stellar spectral types Flare activity is most pronounced in K and M-type stars
which also has the potential of stripping the planetary atmospheres of close-in planets including planets located in the stellar habitable zone For our studies we take DNA as a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules guided by the paradigm that carbon might constitute the biochemical centerpiece of extraterrestrial life forms Planetary atmospheric attenuation is considered in an approximate manner
The formation of a solar system is believed to have followed a multi-stage process around a protostar Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by particle agglomeration is strongly influenced by gas drag; there is a &#34;bottleneck&#34; at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the central star whereas much smaller or larger particles do not
Thus successful planetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scale A commonly accepted picture is that for collisional velocities $V_c$ above a certain threshold collisional velocity ${V_{th}} \sim$ 0 1-10 cm s$^{-1}$ particle agglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and intermolecular forces However if perfect sticking is assumed for all collisions the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth
While previous work has dealt explicitly with the influences of collisional pressures and the possibility of particle fracture or penetration the basic role of the phase behavior of matter--phase diagrams amorphs and polymorphs--has been neglected Here it is demonstrated that novel aspects of surface phase transitions provide a physical basis for efficient sticking through collisional melting or amphorph-/polymorphization and fusion to extend the collisional velocity range of primary accretion to $\Delta V_c \sim$ 1-100 m s$^{-1}$
which bound both turbulent RMS speeds and the velocity differences between boulder sized and small grains $\sim$ 1-50 m s$^{-1}$ Thus as inspiraling meter sized bodies collide with smaller particles in this high velocity collisional fusion regime they grow rapidly to km scales and hence settle into stable Keplerian orbits in $\sim$ 10$^5$ years before photoevaporative wind clears the disk of source material
Tidal friction in exoplanet systems driven by orbits that allow for durable nonzero eccentricities at short heliocentric periods can generate internal heating far in excess of the conditions observed in our own solar system Secular perturbations or a notional 2 1 resonance between a Hot Earth and Hot Jupiter can be used as a baseline to consider the thermal evolution of convecting bodies subject to strong viscoelastic tidal heating
We compare results first from simple models using a fixed Quality factor and Love number and then for three different viscoelastic rheologies the Maxwell body the Standard Anelastic Solid and the Burgers body The SAS and Burgers models are shown to alter the potential for extreme tidal heating by introducing the possibility of new equilibria and multiple response peaks
We find that tidal heating tends to exceed radionuclide heating at periods below 10-30 days and exceed insolation only below 1-2 days Extreme cases produce enough tidal heat to initiate global-scale partial melting and an analysis of tidal limiting mechanisms such as advective cooling for earthlike planets is discussed To explore long term behaviors
Planets have been observed in tight binary systems with separations less than 20 AU A likely formation scenario for such systems involves a dynamical capture after which high relative inclinations are likely and may lead to Kozai oscillations <br>We numerically investigate the fate of an initially coplanar double-planet system in a class of binaries with separation ranging between $12 - 20 $ AU
Dynamical integrations of representative four-body systems are performed each including a hot Jupiter and a second planet on a wider orbit We find that although such systems can remain stable at low relative inclinations ($\lesssim 40^\circ$) high relative inclinations are likely to lead to instabilities This can be avoided if the planets are placed in a \emph{Kozai-stable zone} within which mutual gravitational perturbations can suppress the Kozai mechanism
<br>We investigate the possibility of inducing Kozai oscillations in the inner orbit by a weak coupling mechanism between the planets in which the coplanarity is broken due to a differential nodal precession Propagating perturbations from the stellar companion through a planetary system in this manner can have dramatic effects on the dynamical evolution of planetary systems
especially in tight binaries and can offer a reasonable explanation for eccentricity trends among planets observed in binary systems We find that inducing such oscillations into the orbit of a hot Jupiter is more likely in tight binaries and an upper limit can be set on the binary separation above which these oscillations are not observed
In order to reproduce the statistical properties of the observed exoplanets population synthesis models have shown that the migration of protoplanets should be significantly slowed down and that processes stalling migration should be at work Much current theoretical efforts have thus been dedicated to find physical effects that slow down
halt or even reverse migration Many of these studies rely on the horseshoe drag whose long term-evolution (saturated or not) is intimately related to the disk viscosity in laminar disk models We investigate how the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet is altered by a more realistic treatment of the turbulence in protoplanetary disks
Two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are performed with a turbulence model that reproduces the main turbulence properties of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic calculations We find that the horseshoe drag can remain unsaturated on the long term depending on the turbulence strength We show that the desaturation of the horseshoe drag by turbulence can be modeled by vortensity diffusion across the time-averaged planet&#39;s horseshoe region
The first study of migration-induced resonances in a pair of Earth-like planets has been performed by Papaloizou and Szuszkiewicz (2005) They concluded that in the case of disparate masses embedded in a disc with the surface density expected for a minimum mass solar nebula at 5 2 au the most likely resonances are ratios of large integers
such as 8 7 For equal masses planets tend to enter into the 2 1 or 3 2 resonance In Papaloizou and Szuszkiewicz (2005) the two low-mass planets have masses equal to 4 Earth masses chosen to mimic the very well known example of two pulsar planets which are close to the 3
That study has stimulated quite a few interesting questions One of them is considered here namely how the behaviour of the plan- ets close to the mean-motion resonance depends on the actual values of the masses of the planets We have chosen a 3 2 commensurability and investigated the outcome of an orbital migration in the vicinity of this resonance in the case of a pair of equal mass super-Earths
Short duration lensing events tend to be generated by low-mass lenses or by lenses with high transverse velocities Furthermore for any given lens mass and speed events of short duration are preferentially caused by nearby lenses (mesolenses) that can be studied in detail or else by lenses so close to the source star that finite-source-size effects may be detected
yielding information about both the Einstein ring radius and the surface of the lensed star Planets causing short-duration events may be in orbits with any orientation and may have semimajor axes smaller than an AU or they may reach the outer limits of their planetary systems in the region corresponding to the Solar System&#39;s Oort Cloud
They can have masses larger than Jupiter&#39;s or smaller than Pluto&#39;s Lensing therefore has a unique potential to expand our understanding of planetary systems A particular advantage of lensing is that it can provide precision measurements of system parameters including the masses of and projected separation between star and planet
We demonstrate how the parameters can be extracted and show that a great deal can be learned For example it is remarkable that the gravitational mass of nearby free-floating planet-mass lenses can be measured by complementing observations of a photometric event with deep images that detect the planet itself A fraction of short events may be caused by high-velocity stars located within a kpc
Many high-velocity lenses are likely to be neutron stars that received large natal kicks Other high-speed stars may be members of the halo population Still others may be hypervelocity stars that have been ejected from the Galactic Center or runaway stars escaped from close binaries possibly including the progenitor binaries of Type Ia supernovae
Stellar irradiation and particles forcing strongly affect the immediate environment of extrasolar giant planets orbiting near their parent stars Here we use far-ultraviolet emission spectra from HD209458 in the wavelength range (1180-1710)A to bring new insight to the composition and energetic processes in play in the gas nebula around the transiting planetary companion
In that frame we consider up-to-date atmospheric models of the giant exoplanet where we implement non-thermal line broadening to simulate the impact on the transit absorption of superthermal atoms (HI OI and CII) populating the upper layers of the nebula Our sensitivity study shows that for all existing models a significant line broadening is required for OI and probably for CII lines in order to fit the observed transit absorptions
In that frame we show that OI and CII are preferentially heated compared to the background gas with effective temperatures as large as T_{OI}/T_B~10 for OI and T_{CII}/T_B~5 for CII By contrast the situation is much less clear for HI because several models could fit the Lyman-a observations including either thermal HI in an atmosphere that has a dayside vertical column [HI]~1
or a less extended thermal atmosphere but with hot HI atoms populating the upper layers of the nebula If the energetic HI atoms are either of stellar origin or populations lost from the planet and energized in the outer layers of the nebula our finding is that most models should converge toward one hot population that has an HI vertical column in the range [HI]_{hot}(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2} and an effective temperature in the range T_{HI}(1-1
We have observed well-sampled phase curves for nine Trojan asteroids in B- V- and I-bands These were constructed from 778 magnitudes taken with the 1 3-m telescope on Cerro Tololo as operated by a service observer for the SMARTS consortium Over our typical phase range of 0 2-10 deg we find our phase curves to be adequately described by a linear model
for slopes of 0 04-0 09 mag/deg with average uncertainty less than 0 02 mag/deg (The one exception 51378 (2001 AT33) has a formally negative slope of -0 02 +- 0 01 mag/deg ) These slopes are too steep for the opposition surge mechanism to be shadow hiding (SH) so we conclude that the dominant surge mechanism must be coherent backscattering (CB)
In a detailed comparison of surface properties (including surge slope B-R color and albedo) we find that the Trojans have surface properties similar to the P and C class asteroids prominent in the outer main belt yet they have significantly different surge properties (at a confidence level of 99 90%)
This provides an imperfect argument against the traditional idea that the Trojans were formed around Jupiter&#39;s orbit We also find no overlap in Trojan properties with either the main belt asteroids or with the small icy bodies in the outer Solar System Importantly we find that the Trojans are indistinguishable from other small bodies in the outer Solar System that have lost their surface ices (such as the gray Centaurs
We apply ionization balance and MHD calculations to investigate whether magnetic activity moderated by recombination on dust can account for the mass accretion rates and the mid-infrared spectra and variability of protostellar disks The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the resistivity of the gas
The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity but can be produced by varying these together with the disk magnetic flux The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence
through three effects (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically inactive dead zone extending above two scale heights while turbulence in the magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only about one scale height (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically in waves driven by the turbulent layer above
but on average settle at the laminar rates so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk atmosphere becomes dust-depleted (3) With sufficient depletion the dead zone is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane The MHD results also show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the atmosphere
The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few orbits while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface varies by factors of two over times down to 0 1 orbit We suggest that the changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the daily to monthly mid-infrared variability in some young stars
The concept of the Circumstellar Habitable Zone has served the scientific community well for some decades It slips easily off the tongue and it would be hard to replace Recently however several workers have postulated types of habitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances from their parent stars
but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained internal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with geothermally-maintained surface oceans which have been ejected from unstable planetary systems into interstellar space If habitability is not a unique and diagnostic property of the HZ then the value of the term has been compromised in a fundamental way
At the same time it has become evident that multiple environmental states differing in important ways in their habitability are possible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of insolation within the classic HZ We discuss an approach to investigations of planetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems
which are here termed - ecospheres This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists such as Huggett (1999) rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953) and Dole (1964) who used it as a term for the HZ This approach emphasizes ecodynamic perspectives which explore the dynamic interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems
The highly irradiated transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b currently provides one of the best opportunities for studying planetary emission in the optical and infrared wavelengths We observe six near-consecutive secondary eclipses of HAT-P-7b at optical wavelengths with the EPOXI spacecraft We place an upper limit on the relative eclipse depth of 0
We also analyze Spitzer observations of the same target in the infrared obtaining secondary eclipse depths of 0 098+/-0 017% 0 159+/-0 022% 0 245+/-0 031% and 0 225+/-0 052% in the 3 6 4 5 5 8 and 8 0 micron IRAC bands respectively We combine these measurements with the recently published Kepler secondary eclipse measurement
and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planet that are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements The data are best fit by models with a temperature inversion as expected from the high incident flux The models predict a low optical albedo of ~&lt; 0 13 with subsolar abundances of Na
K TiO and VO We also find that the best fitting models predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to the night side of the planet which is qualitatively consistent with the inefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the Kepler phase curve Models without thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1
and also require an overabundance of methane which is not expected in the very hot atmosphere of HAT-P-7b We also analyze the eight transits of HAT-P-7b present in the EPOXI dataset and improve the constraints on the system parameters finding a period of P = 2 2047308+/-0 0000025 days a stellar radius of R* = 1
We compute models of the transmission spectra of planets HD 209458b HD 189733b and generic hot Jupiters We examine the effects of temperature surface gravity and metallicity for the generic planets as a guide to understanding transmission spectra in general We find that carbon dioxide absorption at 4 4 and 15 microns is prominent at high metallicity
and is a clear metallicity indicator For HD 209458b and HD 189733b we compute spectra for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional model atmospheres and examine the differences between them The differences are usually small but can be large if atmospheric temperatures are near important chemical abundance boundaries The calculations for the 3D atmospheres
and their comparison with data serve as constraints on these dynamical models that complement the secondary eclipse and light curve data sets For HD 209458b even if TiO and VO gases are abundant on the day side their abundances can be considerably reduced on the cooler planetary limb However given the predicted limb temperatures and TiO abundances
the model&#39;s optical opacity is too high For HD 189733b we find a good match with some infrared data sets and constrain the altitude of a postulated haze layer For this planet substantial differences can exist between the transmission spectra of the leading and trailing hemispheres which is an excellent probe of carbon chemistry
We present an analysis of the bulk composition of the MEarth transiting super Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b using planet interior structure models We consider three possible origins for the gas layer on GJ 1214b direct accretion of gas from the protoplanetary nebula sublimation of ices and outgassing from rocky material
Armed only with measurements of the planet mass (M_p=6 55+/-0 98 M_{earth}) radius (R_p=2 678+/-0 13 R_{earth}) and stellar irradiation level our main conclusion is that we cannot infer a unique composition A diverse range of planet interiors fits the measured planet properties Nonetheless GJ 1214b&#39;s relatively low average density (rho_p=1870+/-400 kg m^{-3}) means that it almost certainly has a significant gas component
Our second major conclusion is that under most conditions we consider GJ 1214b would not have liquid water Even if the outer envelope is predominantly sublimated water ice the envelope will likely consist of a super-fluid layer sandwiched between vapor above and plasma (electrically conductive fluid) below at greater depths
During the late stage of planet formation when Mars-size cores appear interactions among planetary cores can excite their orbital eccentricities speed their merges and thus sculpture the final architecture of planet systems This series of work contributes to the final assembling of planet systems with N-body simulations including the type I and II migration of planets
gas accretion of massive cores in a viscous disk In this paper the standard formulations of type I and II migrations are adopted to investigate the formation of planet systems around solar mass stars Statistics on the final distributions of planetary masses semi-major axes and eccentricities are derived which are comparable to those of the observed systems
Our simulations predict some orbital signatures of planet systems around solar mass stars 36% of the survival planets are giant planets (Mp&gt;10Me) Most of the massive giant planets (Mp&gt;30Me) locate at 1-10AU Terrestrial planets distribute more or less evenly at &lt;1-2 AU Planets in inner orbits (&lt;1 AU) may accumulate at the inner edges of either the protostellar disk (3-5 days) or its MRI dead zone (30-50 days)
There is a planet desert in the mass-eccecntricity diagram i e lack of planets with masses 0 005 - 0 08 MJ in highly eccentric orbits (e &gt; 0 3 - 0 4) The average eccentricity (~ 0 15) of the giant planets (Mp&gt;10Me) are bigger than that (~ 0
Motivated by the comments of Goodman (2009) on our paper concerning thermal tides (Arras and Socrates 2009a) we have studied an idealized problem to understand the global response of a completely fluid gas giant planet to thermal forcing at the surface (Arras and Socrates 2009b) Our findings disagree with the main claims in Goodman (2009)
We find that significant quadrupole moments can indeed be induced as a result of thermal forcing Furthermore we find that it is possible for the orientation of the quadrupoles to be such that the planet is torqued away from synchronous rotation Given these results we believe our proposed thermal tide mechanism (Arras and Socrates 2009a) provides a viable scenario for generating steady-state asychronous rotation
We present 44 days of high duty cycle ultra precise photometry of the 13th magnitude star Kepler-5 (KIC 8191672 Teff=6300 K logg=4 1) which exhibits periodic transits with a depth of 0 7% Detailed modeling of the transit is consistent with a planetary companion with an orbital period of 3
Doppler observations from Keck Observatory reveal the presence of a planet with Msini of 2 1 Mjup orbiting the M3V star HIP79431 This is the sixth giant planet to be detected in Doppler surveys of M dwarfs and it is one of the most massive planets discovered around an M dwarf star
We present the first measurement of planet frequency beyond the &#34;snow line&#34; for planet/star mass-ratios[-4 5&lt;log q&lt;-2] d^2 N/dlog q/dlog s=(0 36+-0 15)/dex^2 at mean mass ratio q=5e-4 and consistent with being flat in log projected separation s Our result is based on a sample of 6 planets detected from intensive follow-up of high-mag (A&gt;200) microlensing events during 2005-8
The sample host stars have typical mass M_host 0 5 Msun and detection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations (R_E/s_max R_E*s_max) where R_E 3 5 AU sqrt(M_host/Msun) is the Einstein radius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3} corresponding to deprojected separations ~3 times the &#34;snow line&#34; Though frenetic the observations constitute a &#34;controlled experiment&#34;
which permits measurement of absolute planet frequency High-mag events are rare but the high-mag channel is efficient half of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded planet detections The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7 larger than from RV studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2&lt;P&lt;2000 days]
However this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from RV studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is measured) This suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex in semi-major axis 2 dex in mass ratio and 0 3 dex in host mass Finally if all planetary systems were &#34;analogs&#34; of the Solar System
our sample would have yielded 18 2 planets (11 4 &#34;Jupiters&#34; 6 4 &#34;Saturns&#34; 0 3 &#34;Uranuses&#34; 0 2 &#34;Neptunes&#34;) including 6 1 systems with 2 or more planet detections This compares to 6 planets including one 2-planet system in the actual sample implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems
It has been argued that the photometric data and images of the archetypical debris disk around Vega may be in contradiction with the standard steady-state collisional scenario of the disk evolution Here we perform physical modeling of the Vega disk &#34;from the sources&#34; We assume that dust is maintained by a &#34;Kuiper belt&#34; of parent planetesimals at ~ 100 AU and employ our collisional and radiative transfer codes to consistently model the size and radial distribution of the disk material and then thermal emission of dust
In doing so we vary a broad set of parameters including the stellar properties the exact location extension and dynamical excitation of the planetesimal belt chemical composition of solids and the collisional prescription We are able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution in the entire wavelength range from the near-infrared to millimeter
as well as the mid-IR and sub-millimeter radial brightness profiles of the Vega disk Thus our results suggest that the Vega disk observations are compatible with a steady-state collisional dust production and we put important constraints on the disk parameters and physical processes that sustain it The total disk mass in &lt; 100 km-sized bodies is estimated to be ~ 10 Earth masses
Provided that collisional cascade has been operating over much of the Vega age of ~ 350 Myr the disk must have lost a few Earth masses of solids during that time We also demonstrate that using an intermediate luminosity of the star between the pole and the equator as derived from its fast rotation
The sticking of micron sized dust particles due to surface forces in circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets The key ingredients that drive this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions
Here we present the results of a collision model which is based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU at the midplane at three different gas densities
We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models Furthermore we see long lived quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates due to bouncing We explore how the mass and the porosity change upon varying the turbulence parameter and by varying the critical mass ratio of dust particles
Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10^-4 during the simulations The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations of the gas density and the strength of turbulence The maximum mass of the particles is limited to approximately 1 gram (chondrule-sized particles)
When we are fortunate enough to view an exoplanetary system nearly edge-on the star and planet periodically eclipse each other Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star
as well as the orientation of the planet&#39;s orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons
Accurately determining escape rates from a planet&#39;s atmosphere is critical for determining its evolution Escape can be driven by upward thermal conduction of energy deposited well below the exobase as well as by non-thermal processes produced by energy deposited in the exobase region Recent applications of a model for escape driven by upward thermal conduction
called the slow hydrodynamic escape model have resulted in surprisingly large loss rates for the thick atmosphere of Titan Saturn&#39;s largest moon Based on a molecular kinetic simulation of the exobase region these rates appear to be orders of magnitude too large Because of the large amount of Cassini data already available for Titan&#39;s upper atmosphere and the wealth of data expected within the next decade for the atmospheres of Pluto
Mars and extrasolar planets accurately determining present escape rates is critical for understanding their evolution Therefore the slow hydrodynamic model is evaluated here It is shown that such a model cannot give a reliable description of the atmospheric temperature profile unless it is coupled to a molecular kinetic description of the exobase region
Vesta the second largest Main Belt asteroid will be the first to be explored in 2011 by NASA&#39;s Dawn mission It is a dry likely differentiated body with spectrum suggesting that is has been resurfaced by basaltic lava flows not too different from the lunar maria <br>Here we present the first disk-resolved spectroscopic observations of an asteroid from the ground
We observed (4) Vesta with the ESO-VLT adaptive optics equipped integral-field near-infrared spectrograph SINFONI as part of its science verification campaign The highest spatial resolution of ~90 km on Vesta&#39;s surface was obtained during excellent seeing conditions (0 5&#34;) in October 2004 <br>We observe spectral variations across Vesta&#39;s surface that can be interpreted as variations of either the pyroxene composition
or the effect of surface aging We compare Vesta&#39;s 2 micron absorption band to that of howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites that are thought to originate from Vesta and establish particular links between specific regions and HED subclasses The overallcomposition is found to be mostly compatible with howardite meteorites although a small area around 180 deg
Bayesian Positive Source Separation (BPSS) is a useful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral data unmixing where numerical non-negativity of spectra and abundances has to be ensured such in remote sensing Moreover it is sensible to impose a sum-to-one (full additivity) constraint to the estimated source abundances in each pixel Even though non-negativity and full additivity are two necessary properties to get physically interpretable results
the use of BPSS algorithms has been so far limited by high computation time and large memory requirements due to the Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations An implementation strategy which allows one to apply these algorithms on a full hyperspectral image as typical in Earth and Planetary Science is introduced
We report precise Doppler measurements of the nearby (d = 10 34 pc) M dwarf Gl649 that reveal the presence of a planet with a minimum mass Msini = 0 328 Mjup in an eccentric (e = 0 30) 598 3 day orbit Our photometric monitoring reveals Gl649 to be a new variable star with brightness changes on both rotational and decadal timescales
However neither of these timescales are consistent with the 600-day Doppler signal and so provide strong support for planetary reflex motion as the best interpretation of the observed radial velocity variations Gl649b is only the seventh Doppler-detected giant planet around an M dwarf The properties of the planet and host-star therefore contribute significant information to our knowledge of planet formation around low-mass stars
We revise and refine the occurrence rate of giant planets around M dwarfs based on the California Planet Survey sample of low-mass stars (M* &lt; 0 6 Msun) We find that f = 3 4^{+2 2}_{-0 9}% of stars with M* &lt; 0 6 Msun harbor planets with Msini &gt; 0
We present new analysis of HST images of (47171) 1999 TC36 that confirm it as a triple system Fits to the point-spread function consistently show that the apparent primary is itself composed of two similar-sized components The two central components A1 and A2 can be consistently identified in each of nine epochs spread over seven years of time
In each instance the component separation ranging from 0 023+/-0 002 to 0 031+/-0 003 arcsec is roughly one half of the Hubble Space Telescope&#39;s diffraction limit at 606 nm The orbit of the central pair has a semi-major axis of a~867 km with a period of P~1 9 days
These orbital parameters yield a system mass that is consistent with Msys = 12 75+/-0 06 10^18 kg derived from the orbit of the more distant secondary component B The diameters of the three components are dA1= 286(+45 -38) km dA2= 265(+41 -35 km and dB= 139(+22 -18) km The relative sizes of these components are more similar than in any other known multiple in the solar system
Taken together the diameters and system mass yield a bulk density of p=542(+317 -211) kg m^-3 HST Photometry shows that component B is variable with an amplitude of &gt;=0 17+/-0 05 magnitudes Components A1 and A2 do not show variability larger than 0 08+/-0 03 magnitudes approximately consistent with the orientation of the mutual orbit plane and tidally-distorted equilibrium shapes
We evaluate gravitational lensing as a technique for the detection of extrasolar moons Since 2004 gravitational microlensing has been successfully applied as a detection method for extrasolar planets In principle the method is sensitive to masses as low as an Earth mass or even a fraction of it Hence it seems natural to investigate the microlensing effects of moons around extrasolar planets
We explore the simplest conceivable triple lens system containing one star one planet and one moon From a microlensing point of view this system can be modelled as a particular triple with hierarchical mass ratios very different from unity Since the moon orbits the planet the planet-moon separation will be small compared to the distance between planet and star
Such a configuration can lead to a complex interference of caustics We present detectability and detection limits by comparing triple-lens light curves to best-fit binary light curves as caused by a double-lens system consisting of host star and planet -- without moon We simulate magnification patterns covering a range of mass and separation values using the inverse ray shooting technique
These patterns are processed by analysing a large number of light curves and fitting a binary case to each of them A chi-squared criterion is used to quantify the detectability of the moon in a number of selected triple-lens scenarios The results of our simulations indicate that it is feasible to discover extrasolar moons via gravitational microlensing through frequent and highly precise monitoring of anomalous Galactic microlensing events with dwarf source stars
Do white dwarfs host asteroid systems? Although several lines of argument suggest that white dwarfs may be orbited by large populations of asteroids transits would provide the most direct evidence We demonstrate that the Kepler mission has the capability to detect transits of white dwarfs by asteroids Because white-dwarf asteroid systems
if they exist are likely to contain many asteroids orbiting in a spatially extended distribution discoveries of asteroid transits can be made by monitoring only a small number of white dwarfs compatible with Kepler&#39;s primary mission which is to monitor stars with potentially habitable planets Possible future missions that survey ten times as many stars with similar sensitivity and minute-cadence monitoring can establish the characteristics of asteroid systems around white dwarfs
such as the distribution of asteroid sizes and semimajor axes Transits by planets would be more dramatic but the probability that they will occur is lower Ensembles of planetary moons and/or the presence of rings around planets can also produce transits detectable by Kepler The presence of moons and rings can significantly increase the probability that Kepler will discover planets orbiting white dwarfs
Transiting planet discoveries have yielded a plethora of information towards understanding the structure and atmospheres of extra-solar planets These discoveries have been restricted to the short-period or low-periastron distance regimes due to the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability Through the refinement of planetary orbital parameters and hence reducing the size of transit windows
The majority of extrasolar planets discovered to date have significantly eccentric orbits some if not all of which may have been produced through planetary migration During this process any planets interior to such an orbit would therefore have been susceptible to resonance capture and hence may exhibit measurable orbital period variations
Here we summarize the results of our investigation into the possibility of detecting low-mass planets which have been captured into the strong 2 1 resonance Using analytical expressions together with simulated data we showed that it is possible to identify the existence of a low-mass companion in the internal 2
This works as long as the amplitude of modulation of the orbital period is greater than its uncertainty which in practice means that the system should not be too close to exact resonance Here we provide simple expressions for the libration period and the change in the observed orbital period
We present precision radial velocity (RV) data that reveal a multiple exoplanet system orbiting the bright nearby G5V star 61 Virginis Our 4 6 years of combined Keck/HIRES and Anglo-Australian Telescope precision RVs indicate the hitherto unknown presence of at least three planets orbiting this well-studied star These planets are all on low-eccentricity orbits with periods of 4
and 124 0 days and projected masses (M sini) of 5 1 18 2 and 24 0 M_Earth respectively Test integrations of systems consistent with the RV data suggest that the configuration is dynamically stable Depending on the effectiveness of tidal dissipation within the inner planet the inner two planets may have evolved into an eccentricity fixed-point configuration in which the apsidal lines of all three planets corotate
This conjecture can be tested with additional observations We present a 16-year time series of photometric observations of 61 Virginis which comprise 1194 individual measurements and indicate that it has excellent photometric stability No significant photometric variations at the periods of the proposed planets have been detected This new system is the first known example of a G-type Sun-like star hosting a Super-Earth mass planet
It joins HD 75732 (55 Cnc) HD 69830 GJ 581 HD 40307 and GJ 876 as a growing group of exoplanet systems that have multiple planets orbiting with periods less than an Earth-year The ubiquity of such systems portends that space-based transit-search missions such as KEPLER and COROT will find many multi-transiting systems
We investigate the chemical interaction between Saturn&#39;s corotating plasma and Enceladus&#39; volcanic plumes We evolve plasma as it passes through a prescribed H2O plume using a physical chemistry model adapted for water-group reactions The flow field is assumed to be that of a plasma around an electrically-conducting obstacle centered on Enceladus and aligned with Saturn&#39;s magnetic field
consistent with Cassini magnetometer data We explore the effects on the physical chemistry due to (1) a small population of hot electrons; (2) a plasma flow decelerated in response to the pickup of fresh ions; (3) the source rate of neutral H2O The model confirms that charge exchange dominates the local chemistry and that H3O+ dominates the water-group composition downstream of the Enceladus plumes
Employing a catalog of 175 extrasolar planets (exoplanets) detected by the Doppler-shift method we constructed the independent and coupled mass-period functions It is the first time in this field that the selection effect is considered in the coupled mass-period functions Our results are consistent with those in Tabachnik and Tremaine (2002) with the major differences that we obtain a flatter mass function but a steeper period function
Asynchronous rotation and orbital eccentricity lead to time-dependent irradiation of the close-in gas giant exoplanets -- the hot Jupiters This time-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate throughout the planet We investigate the ability of this &#34;thermal tide&#34; to produce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal force
While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces here we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with small cores The Coriolis force thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the perturbations are ignored for simplicity First we examine the response to thermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat the forcing frequency as a small parameter
In the &#34;equilibrium tide&#34; limit of zero frequency fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole moment In the next approximation finite frequency corrections to the equilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment the sign of which torques the planet {\it away} from synchronous spin We then numerically solve the boundary value problem for the thermally forced
linear response of a planet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope The numerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic non-resonant result at sufficiently long forcing period Surprisingly in the range of forcing periods of 1-30 days the induced quadrupole moments can be far larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves which propagate in the radiative envelope
In this review I briefly summarize the present status of experimental and theoretical investigations of the properties of matter under conditions characteristic of planetary interiors from terrestrial to jovian planets I first focus on the two lightest elements hydrogen and helium and discuss recent theoretical and experimental investigations of their properties at high pressure and temperature
We report the discovery of diffuse hard (1-5 keV) X-ray emission around Jupiter in a deep 160 ks Suzaku XIS data The emission is distributed over ~16x8 Jovian radius and spatially associated with the radiation belts and the Io Plasma Torus It shows a flat power-law spectrum with a photon index of 1
We discussed its origin and concluded that it seems to be truly diffuse although a possibility of multiple background point sources can not be completely rejected with a limited angular resolution If it is diffuse the flat continuum indicates that X-rays arise by the non-thermal electrons in the radiation belts and/or the Io Plasma Torus
The synchrotron and bremsstrahlung models can be rejected from the necessary electron energy and X-ray spectral shape respectively The inverse-Compton scattering off solar photons by ultra-relativistic (several tens MeV) electrons can explain the energy and the spectrum but the necessary electron density is &gt;~10 times larger than the value estimated from the empirical model of Jovian charge particles
We consider the unrestricted problem of two mutually attracting rigid bodies an uniform sphere (or a point mass) and an axially symmetric body We present a global geometric approach for finding all relative equilibria (stationary solutions) in this model which was already studied by Kinoshita (1970) We extend and generalize his results
showing that the equilibria solutions may be found by solving at most two non-linear algebraic equations assuming that the potential function of the symmetric rigid body is known explicitly We demonstrate that there are three classes of the relative equilibria which we call &#34;cylindrical&#34; &#34;inclined co-planar&#34; and &#34;conic&#34; precessions respectively
BD+20 1790 is a young active metal-rich late-type K5Ve star We have undertaken a study of stellar activity and kinematics for this star over the past few years Previous results show a high level of stellar activity with the presence of prominence-like structures spots on the surface and strong flare events
despite the moderate rotational velocity of the star In addition radial velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of up to 1 km/s were detected We investigated the nature of these radial velocity variations in order to determine whether they are due to stellar activity or the reflex motion of the star induced by a companion
We have analysed high-resolution echelle spectra and also two-band photometry was obtained to produce the light curve and determine the photometric period Based upon the analysis of the bisector velocity span as well as spectroscopic indices of chromospheric indicators and taking into account the photometric analysis we report that the best explanation for the RV variation is the presence of a sub-stellar companion
The Keplerian fit of the RV data yields a solution for a close-in massive planet with an orbital period of 7 78 days The presence of the close-in massive planet could also be an interpretation for the high level of stellar activity detected Since the RV data are not part of a planet search program
The newly discovered planet GJ 1214b is the first known transiting super-Earth requiring a significant atmosphere to explain its observed mass and radius Models for the structure of this planet predict that it likely possesses a H-He envelope of at least 0 05% of the total mass of the planet
However models without a significant H-He atmosphere are not entirely ruled out by the available data Here we explore a range of possible atmospheres for the planet ranging from solar composition gas to pure CO_2 or water (steam) We present transmission and emission spectra for each of these cases We find that
if GJ 1214b possesses a hydrogen-rich atmosphere as expected then the primary transit depth for such an atmosphere would vary at a level of up to 0 3% as a function of wavelength relative to the background light of its M-dwarf host star Observations at this level of precision are potentially obtainable with current space-based instrumentation
Successful detection of the transmission signature of this planet at the ~0 1% level would therefore provide confirmation of the hydrogen-rich nature of the planetary atmosphere It follows that transmission spectroscopy at this level of precision could provide a first glimpse into answering the question of whether planets in the super-Earth mass regime (1 - 10 M_Earth) more closely resemble large terrestrial planets or small gas giant planets
A time series of the Martian south ice polar cap mean diameter for the period July-December 1924 is investigated The data are based on the high quality pictures which are obtained by visual observations of 60 cm telescope in Hamburg Observatory during the great opposition of Mars in AD 1924
After removing of the seasonal trend (caused by the springtime regression of the cap) quasi 36 and 80-82 days cycles in residuals has been obtained The sunspot activity spectra for the corresponding period is almost the same one The local maximums of polar cap area residuals has been occured of about 10 days after the corresponding minimums of sunspot activity
We acquired and analyzed adaptive-optics imaging observations of asteroid (2) Pallas from Keck II and the Very Large Telescope taken during four Pallas oppositions between 2003 and 2007 with spatial resolution spanning 32-88 km (image scales 13-20 km/pix) We improve our determination of the size shape and pole by a novel method that combines our AO data with 51 visual light-curves spanning 34 years of observations as well as occultation data
<br>The shape model of Pallas derived here reproduces well both the projected shape of Pallas on the sky and light-curve behavior at all the epochs considered We resolved the pole ambiguity and found the spin-vector coordinates to be within 5 deg of [long lat] = [30 deg -16 deg ] in the ECJ2000
indicating a high obliquity of ~84 deg leading to high seasonal contrast The best triaxial-ellipsoid fit returns radii of a=275 km b= 258 km and c= 238 km From the mass of Pallas determined by gravitational perturbation on other minor bodies [(1 2 +/- 0 3) x 10-10 Solar Masses]
we derive a density of 3 4 +/- 0 9 <a href="http //g cm" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a>-3 significantly different from the density of C-type (1) Ceres of 2 2 +/- 0 1 <a href="http //g cm" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a>-3 Considering the spectral similarities of Pallas and Ceres at visible and near-infrared wavelengths
this may point to fundamental differences in the interior composition or structure of these two bodies <br>We define a planetocentric longitude system for Pallas following IAU guidelines We also present the first albedo maps of Pallas covering ~80% of the surface in K-band These maps reveal features with diameters in the 70-180 km range and an albedo contrast of about 6% wrt the mean surface albedo
Ongoing microlensing observations by OGLE and MOA regularly identify and conduct high-cadence sampling of lensing events with Einstein diameter crossing time tau_E of 16 or fewer days Events with estimated values of tau_E of one to two days have been detected Short duration events tend to be generated by low-mass lenses or by lenses with high transverse velocities
We compute the expected rates demonstrate the expected ranges of parameters for lenses of different mass and develop a protocol for observing and modeling short-duration events Relatively minor additions to the procedures presently used will increase the rate of planet discovery and also discover or place limits on the population of high-speed dim stars and stellar remnants in the vicinity of the Sun
We review how tides may impact the habitability of terrestrial-like planets If such planets form around low-mass stars then planets in the circumstellar habitable zone will be close enough to their host stars to experience strong tidal forces We discuss 1) decay of semi-major axis 2) circularization of eccentric orbits
One of the most challenging problems we face in our understanding of planet formation is how Jupiter and Saturn could have formed before the the solar nebula dispersed The most popular model of giant planet formation is the so-called &#39;core accretion&#39; model In this model a large planetary embryo formed first
mainly by two-body accretion This is then followed by a period of inflow of nebular gas directly onto the growing planet The core accretion model has an Achilles heel namely the very first step We have undertaken the most comprehensive study of this process to date In this study we numerically integrate the orbits of a number of planetary embryos embedded in a swarm of planetesimals
In these experiments we have included 1) aerodynamic gas drag 2) collisional damping between planetesimals 3) enhanced embryo cross-sections due to their atmospheres 4) planetesimal fragmentation and 5) planetesimal driven migration We find that the gravitational interaction between the embryos and the planetesimals lead to the wholesale redistribution of material - regions are cleared of material and gaps open near the embryos
Indeed in 90% of our simulations without fragmentation the region near that embryos is cleared of planetesimals before much growth can occur The remaining 10% however the embryos undergo a burst of outward migration that significantly increases growth On timescales of ~100 000 years the outer embryo can migrate ~6 AU and grow to roughly 30 Earth-masses
We report the detection of a planetary system around BD-08 2823 that includes at least one Uranus-mass planet and one Saturn-mass planet This discovery serendipitously originates from a search for planetary transits in the Hipparcos photometry database This program preferentially selected active stars and did not allow the detection of new transiting planets
It allowed however the identification of the K3V star BD-08 2823 as a target harboring a multiplanet system that we secured and characterized thanks to an intensive monitoring with the HARPS spectrograph at the 3 6-m ESO telescope in La Silla The stellar activity level of BD-08 2823 complicates the analysis but does not prohibit the detection of two planets around this star
BD-08 2823b has a minimum mass of 14 4+/-2 1 M_Earth and an orbital period of 5 60 days whereas BD-08 2823c has a minimum mass of 0 33+/-0 03 M_Jup and an orbital period of 237 6 days This new system strengthens the fact that low-mass planets are preferentially found in multiplanetary systems
The CoRoT satellite exoplanetary team announces its sixth transiting planet in this paper We describe and discuss the satellite observations as well as the complementary ground-based observations - photometric and spectroscopic - carried out to assess the planetary nature of the object and determine its specific physical parameters The discovery reported here is a `hot Jupiter&#39; planet in an 8
or 0 08 AU away from its primary star which is a solar-type star (F9V) with an estimated age of 3 0 Gyr The planet mass is close to 3 times that of Jupiter The star has a metallicity of 0 2 dex lower than the Sun and a relatively high $^7$Li abundance
We present an observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the planetary system WASP-3 Radial velocity measurements were made during transit using the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1 93m telescope at Haute-Provence Observatory The shape of the effect shows that the sky-projected angle between the stellar rotation axis and planetary orbital axis (lambda) is small and consistent with zero within 2 sigma; lambda = 15 +10/-9 deg
WASP-3b joins the ~two-thirds of planets with measured spin-orbit angles that are well aligned and are thought to have undergone a dynamically-gentle migration process such as planet-disc interactions We find a systematic effect which leads to an anomalously high determination of the projected stellar rotational velocity (vsini = 19 6 +2
This is thought to be caused by a discrepancy in the assumptions made in the extraction and modelling of the data Using a model developed by Hirano et al (2009) designed to address this issue we find vsini to be consistent with the value obtained from spectroscopic broadening measurements (vsini = 15
Planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star However an additional planetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems In such systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars where mass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could form an accretion disk around it
Such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for and/or interact with the second generation planets possibly forming atypical planetary systems
Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems and may show various observational signatures Most notably second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible or less favorable for first generation planets The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries
In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries Observations of planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions may serve to uniquely identify their second generation character Finally we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems including PSR B1620-26 (in a globular cluster)
With the development of high contrast imaging techniques and infrared detectors vast efforts have been devoted during the past decade to detect and characterize lighter cooler and closer companions to nearby stars and ultimately image new planetary systems Complementary to other observing techniques (radial velocity transit micro-lensing pulsar-timing) this approach has opened a new astrophysical window to study the physical properties and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs and planets
I here will briefly present the observing challenge the different observing techniques strategies and samples of current exoplanet imaging searches that have been selected in the context of the LAOG-Planet Imaging Surveys I will finally describe the most recent results that led to the discovery of giant planets probably formed like the ones of our solar system
We report the discovery of a planetary system around HD9446 performed from radial velocity measurements secured with the spectrograph SOPHIE at the 193-cm telescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory during more than two years At least two planets orbit this G5V active star HD9446b has a minimum mass of 0 7 M_Jup and a slightly eccentric orbit with a period of 30 days
In our present study the observed linear polarization data of comet Hyakutake are studied at wavelengths $\lambda=0 365\mu m$ $\lambda=0 485\mu m$ and 0 684$\mu m$ through simulations using Ballistic Particle-Cluster Aggregate and Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregate aggregates of 128 spherical monomers We first investigated that the size parameter of the monomer
$x$ $\sim$ 1 56 -- 1 70 turned out to be most suitable which provides the best fits to the observed dust scattering properties at three wavelengths $\lambda = 0 365$$\mu m$ 0 485$\mu m$ and 0 684$\mu m$ Thus the effective radius of the aggregate (r) lies in the range $0
Now using superposition \textsc{t-matrix} code and the power-law size distribution $n(r) \sim r^{-3}$ the best-fitting values of complex refractive indices are calculated which can best fit the observed polarization data at the above three wavelengths The best-fitting complex refractive indices $(n k)$ are found to be (1 745 0 095) at $\lambda = 0
(1 743 0 100) at $\lambda = 0 485 $ $\mu m$ and (1 695 0 100) at $\lambda = 0 684$ $\mu m$ The refractive indices coming out from the present analysis correspond to mixture of both silicates and organics which are in good agreement with the \textit{in situ} measurement of comets by different spacecraft
We propose that magnetic reconnection at the heliopause only occurs where the interstellar magnetic field points nearly anti-parallel to the heliospheric field By using large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the heliosphere to provide the initial conditions for kinetic simulations of heliopause (HP) reconnection we show that the energetic pickup ions downstream from the solar wind termination shock induce large diamagnetic drifts in the reconnecting plasma and stabilize non-anti-parallel reconnection
With this constraint the MHD simulations can show where HP reconnection most likely occurs We also suggest that reconnection triggers the 2-3 kHz radio bursts that emanate from near the HP Requiring the burst locations to coincide with the loci of anti-parallel reconnection allows us to determine for the first time
This brief paper summarizes a ``key general review&#39;&#39; with the same title given at the IAU meeting in Rio de Janeiro The intent of the review talk was to give a broad and well-illustrated overview of recent work on the icy middle and outer Solar system in a style interesting for those astronomers whose gaze is otherwise drawn to more distant realms
The Kepler Mission was launched on March 6 2009 to perform a photometric survey of more than 100 000 dwarf stars to search for terrestrial-size planets with the transit technique Follow-up observations of planetary candidates identified by detection of transit-like events are needed both for identification of astrophysical phenomena that mimic planetary transits and for characterization of the true planets and planetary systems found by Kepler
We determined the flux ratios of the heavy and eccentric planet XO-3b to its parent star in the four IRAC bands of the Spitzer Space Telescope 0 101% +- 0 004% at 3 6 micron; 0 143% +- 0 006% at 4 5 micron; 0 134% +- 0 049% at 5
The flux ratios are within [-2 2 0 3 -0 8 -1 7]-sigma of the model of XO-3b with a thermally inverted stratosphere in the 3 6 micron 4 5 micron 5 8 micron and 8 0 micron channels respectively XO-3b has a high illumination from its parent star (Fp ~(1
which we indeed observe When combined with existing data for other planets the correlation between the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion and the substellar flux is insufficient to explain why some high insolation planets like TrES-3 do not have stratospheric inversions and some low insolation planets like XO-1b do have inversions
Secondary factors such as sulfur chemistry atmospheric metallicity amounts of macroscopic mixing in the stratosphere or even dynamical weather effects likely play a role Using the secondary eclipse timing centroids we determined the orbital eccentricity of XO-3b as e = 0 277 +- 0 009 The model radius-age trajectories for XO-3b imply that at least some amount of tidal-heating is required to inflate the radius of XO-3b
We present a new approach for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of the close-in giant planet HD209458b that allows for the decoupling of radiative and thermal energies direct stellar heating of the interior and the solution of the full 3D Navier Stokes equations Simulations reveal two distinct temperature inversions (increasing temperature with decreasing pressure) at the sub-stellar point due to the combined effects of opacity and dynamical flow structure and exhibit instabilities leading to changing velocities and temperatures on the nightside for a range of viscosities
Imposed on the quasi-static background temperature variations of up to 15% are seen near the terminators and the location of the coldest spot is seen to vary by more than 20 degrees occasionally appearing west of the anti-solar point Our new approach introduces four major improvements to our previous methods including simultaneously solving both the thermal energy and radiative equations in both the optical and infrared
Optical images of the nearby star Fomalhaut show a ring of dust orbiting the central star This dust is in many respects expected to be similar to the zodiacal dust in the solar system The ring displays a clear brightness asymmetry attributed to asymmetric scattering of the central starlight by the circumstellar dust grains
Recent measurements show that the bright side of the Fomalhaut ring is oriented away from us This implies that the grains in this system scatter most of the light in the backward direction in sharp contrast to the forward-scattering nature of the grains in the solar system In this letter
we show that grains considerably larger than those dominating the solar system zodiacal dust cloud provide a natural explanation for the apparent backward scattering behavior In fact we see the phases of the dust grains in the same way as we can observe the phases of the Moon and other large solar system bodies
We outline how the theory of the scattering behavior of planetesimals can be used to explain the Fomalhaut dust properties This indicates that the Fomalhaut dust ring is dominated by very large grains The material orbiting Fomalhaut which is at the transition between dust and planetesimals can with respect to their optical behavior
In this paper we show that the eccentricity of a planet on an inclined orbit with respect to a disc can be pumped up to high values by the gravitational potential of the disc even when the orbit of the planet crosses the disc plane This process is an extension of the Kozai effect
If the orbit of the planet is well inside the disc inner cavity the process is formally identical to the classical Kozai effect If the planet&#39;s orbit crosses the disc but most of the disc mass is beyond the orbit the eccentricity of the planet grows when the initial angle between the orbit and the disc is larger than some critical value which may be significantly smaller than the classical value of 39 degrees
Stellar spots may in some cases produce radial velocity (RV) signatures similar to those of exoplanets To further investigate the impact of spots we aim at studying the detectability of Earth mass planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of solar type stars if covered by spots similar to the sunspots
We have used the Sunspots properties recorded over one solar cycle between 1993 and 2003 to build the RV curve that a solar type star seen edge-on would show if covered by such spots with Tsun -Tspot = 550K We also simulate the RV of such a spotted star surrounded by an Earth mass planet located in the HZ
Under present assumptions the detection of a 1 M Earth planet located between 0 8 and 1 2 AU requires an intensive monitoring (weekly or better) during several years of low activity phasis The temporal sampling is more crucial than the precision of the data (assuming precisions in the range [1-10] cm/s)
We present a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of extrasolar planets that takes into account the eccentricity of their orbit In addition to the modulation of stellar irradiation by the varying planet-star distance the pseudo-synchronous rotation of the planets may play a significant role We include both of these time-dependent effects when modeling the planetary thermal structure
We report a transit timing study of the transiting exoplanetary system HD 189733 In total we observed ten transits in 2006 and 2008 with the 2 6-m Nordic Optical Telescope and two transits in 2007 with the 4 2-m William Herschel Telescope We used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations to derive the system parameters and their uncertainties
and our results are in a good agreement with previously published values We performed two independent analyses of transit timing residuals to place upper mass limits on putative perturbing planets The results show no evidence for the presence of planets down to 1 Earth mass near the 1 2 and 2
Relativistic modelling of rotational motion of extended bodies represents one of the most complicated problems of Applied Relativity The relativistic reference systems of IAU (2000) give a suitable theoretical framework for such a modelling Recent developments in the post-Newtonian theory of Earth rotation in the limit of rigidly rotating multipoles are reported below
All components of the theory are summarized and the results are demonstrated The experience with the relativistic Earth rotation theory can be directly applied to model the rotational motion of other celestial bodies The high-precision theories of rotation of the Moon Mars and Mercury can be expected to be of interest in the near future
A highly favoured mechanism of planetesimal formation is collisional growth Single dust grains which follow gas flows in the protoplanetary disc hit each other stick due to van der Waals forces and form fluffy aggregates up to centimetre size The mechanism of further growth is unclear since the outcome of aggregate collisions in the relevant velocity and size regime cannot be investigated in the laboratory under protoplanetary disc conditions
Realistic statistics of the result of dust aggregate collisions beyond decimetre size is missing for a deeper understanding of planetary growth Joining experimental and numerical efforts we want to calibrate and validate a computer program that is capable of a correct simulation of the macroscopic behaviour of highly porous dust aggregates
After testing its numerical limitations thoroughly we will check the program especially for a realistic reproduction of various benchmark experiments We adopt the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of solid bodies and a modified version of the Sirono porosity model Experimentally measured macroscopic material properties of silica dust are implemented
We calibrate and test for the compressive strength relation and the bulk modulus SPH has already proven to be a suitable tool to simulate collisions at rather high velocities In this work we demonstrate that its area of application can not only be extended to low-velocity experiments and collisions It can also be used to simulate the behaviour of highly porous objects in this velocity regime to a very high <a href="http
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) has thus far failed to provide a convincing detection of intelligent life In the wake of this null signal many &#34;contact pessimistic&#34; hypotheses have been formulated the most famous of which is the Rare Earth Hypothesis It postulates that although terrestrial planets may be common
the exact environmental conditions that Earth enjoys are rare perhaps unique As a result simple microbial life may be common but complex metazoans (and hence intelligence) will be rare This paper uses Monte Carlo Realisation Techniques to investigate the Rare Earth Hypothesis in particular the environmental criteria considered imperative to the existence of intelligence on Earth
<br>By comparing with a less restrictive more optimistic hypothesis the data indicates that if the Rare Earth hypothesis is correct intelligent civilisation will indeed be relatively rare Studying the separations of pairs of civilisations shows that most intelligent civilisation pairs (ICPs) are unconnected that is they will not be able to exchange signals at lightspeed in the limited time that both are extant
However the few ICPs that are connected are strongly connected being able to participate in numerous exchanges of signals This may provide encouragement for SETI researchers although the Rare Earth Hypothesis is in general a contact-pessimistic hypothesis it may be a &#34;soft&#34; or &#34;exclusive&#34; hypothesis i e it may contain facets that are latently contact-optimistic
Cluster observations in the near-Earth magnetotail have shown that sometimes the current sheet is bifurcated i e it is divided in two layers The influence of magnetic turbulence on ion motion in this region is investigated by numerical simulation taking into account the presence of both protons and oxygen ions
The magnetotail current sheet is modeled as a magnetic field reversal with a normal magnetic field component $B_n$ plus a three-dimensional spectrum of magnetic fluctuations $\delta {\bf B}$ which represents the observed magnetic turbulence The dawn-dusk electric field E$_y$ is also included A test particle simulation is performed using different values of $\delta {\bf B}$
E$_y$ and injecting two different species of particles O$^+$ ions and protons O$^+$ ions can support the formation of a double current layer both in the absence and for large values of magnetic fluctuations ($\delta B/B_0 = 0 0$ and $\delta B/B_0 \geq 0 4$ where B$_0$ is the constant magnetic field in the magnetospheric lobes)
Stellar activity produced by spots and plages affects the radial velocity (RV) signatures Because even low activity stars would produce such a signal it is crucial to determine how it influences our ability to detect small planetary signals such as those produced by Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone (HZ)
In a recent paper we investigated the impact of sunlike spots We aim here to investigate the additional impact of plages We used the spot and plage properties over a solar cycle to derive the RV that would be observed if the Sun was seen edge-on The RV signal comes from the photometric contribution of spots and plages and from the attenuation of the convective blueshift in plages
We compared the RV signal with the signal that would be produced by an Earth-mass planet in the HZ We find that the photometric contributions of spots and plages to the RV signal partially balance each other out so that the residual signal is comparable to the spot signal However
the plage contribution due to the convective blueshift attenuation dominates the total signal with an amplitude over the solar cycle of about 8-10 m/s This contribution is very strongly correlated with the Ca index on the long term which may be a way to distinguish between stellar activity and a planet
Providing a very good temporal sampling and signal-to-noise ratio the photometric contribution of plages and spots should not prevent detection of Earth-mass planets in the HZ However the convection contribution makes such a direct detection impossible unless its effect can be corrected for by methods that still need to be found
HR 8799 is a multi-planet system detected in direct imaging with three companions known so far Here we present spatially resolved VLT/NACO 3 88--4 10 micron spectroscopy of the middle planet HR 8799 c which has an estimated mass of ~10 Mjup temperature of ~1100 K and projected separation of 38 AU
We have analyzed the first 3 75 years of data from TAOS the Taiwanese American Occultation Survey TAOS monitors bright stars to search for occultations by Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) This dataset comprises 5e5 star-hours of multi-telescope photometric data taken at 4 or 5 Hz No events consistent with KBO occultations were found in this dataset
We compute the number of events expected for the Kuiper Belt formation and evolution models of Pan &amp; Sari (2005) Kenyon &amp; Bromley (2004) Benavidez &amp; Campo Bagatin (2009) and Fraser (2009) A comparison with the upper limits we derive from our data constrains the parameter space of these models
[Abridged] If both the day-side and night-side effective temperatures of a planet can be measured it is possible to estimate its Bond albedo 0&lt;A_B&lt;1 as well as its day-night heat redistribution efficiency 0&lt;epsilon&lt;1 We attempt a statistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24 transiting exoplanets that have at least one published secondary eclipse
For each planet we show how to calculate a sub-stellar equilibrium temperature T_0 and associated uncertainty We then use a simple model-independent technique to estimate a planet&#39;s effective temperature from planet/star flux ratios We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements -those obtained at lambda&gt;0 8 micron- to estimate day-side effective temperatures
T_d and thermal phase variations -when available- to estimate night-side effective temperature We strongly rule out the &#34;null hypothesis&#34; of a single A_B and epsilon for all 24 planets If we allow each planet to have different parameters we find that low Bond albedos are favored (A_B&lt;0 35 at 1 sigma confidence)
which is an independent confirmation of the low albedos inferred from non-detection of reflected light Our sample exhibits a wide variety of redistribution efficiencies When normalized by T_0 the day-side effective temperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution The dimensionless quantity T_d/T_0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absence of stratospheric inversions
There is also no clear trend between T_d/T_0 and T_0 That said the 6 planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibrium temperatures (T&gt;2400 K) have low epsilon as opposed to the 18 cooler planets which show a variety of recirculation efficiencies This hints that the very hottest transiting giant planets are qualitatively different from the merely hot Jupiters
Early time-series photometry from NASA&#39;s Kepler spacecraft has revealed a planet transiting the star we term Kepler-4 at RA = 19h02m27 68s Dec = +50 08 08 7 The planet has an orbital period of 3 213 days and shows transits with a relative depth of 0 87 x 10^{-3} and a duration of about 3
Radial velocity measurements from the Keck HIRES spectrograph show a reflex Doppler signal of 9 3 (+1 1 -1 9) m/s consistent with a low-eccentricity orbit with the phase expected from the transits Various tests show no evidence for any companion star near enough to affect the light curve or the radial velocities for this system
From a transit-based estimate of the host star&#39;s mean density combined with analysis of high-resolution spectra we infer that the host star is near turnoff from the main sequence with estimated mass and radius of 1 223 (+0 053 -0 091) solar masses and 1 487 (+0 071 -0 084) solar radii
Tremendous progress in the science of extrasolar planets has been achieved since the discovery of a Jupiter orbiting the nearby Sun-like star 51 Pegasi in 1995 Theoretical models have now reached enough maturity to predict the characteristic properties of these new worlds mass radius atmospheric signatures and can be confronted with available observations
We review our current knowledge of the physical properties of exoplanets internal structure and composition atmospheric signatures including expected biosignatures for exo-Earth planets evolution and the impact of tidal interaction and stellar irradiation on these properties for the short-period planets We discuss the most recent theoretical achievements in the field and the still pending questions
We critically analyse the different solutions suggested to explain abnormally large radii of a significant fraction of transiting exoplanets Special attention is devoted to the recently discovered transiting objects in the overlapping mass range between massive planets and low-mass brown dwarfs stressing the ambiguous nature of these bodies and we discuss the possible observable diagnostics to identify these two distinct populations
Five new planets orbiting G and K dwarfs have emerged from the Magellan velocity survey These companions are jovian-mass planets in eccentric (e \geq 0 24) intermediate and long-period orbits HD 86226b orbits a solar metallicity G2 dwarf The MP sin i mass of the planet is 1 5 MJUP
the semi-major axis is 2 6 AU and the eccentricity 0 73 HD 129445b orbits a metal rich G6 dwarf The minimum mass of the planet is MP sin i =1 6 MJUP the semi-major axis is 2 9 AU and the eccentricity 0 70 HD 164604b orbits a K2 dwarf
The MP sin i mass is 2 7 MJUP semi-major axis is 1 3 AU and the eccentricity is 0 24 HD 175167b orbits a metal rich G5 star The MP sin i mass is 7 8 MJUP the semi-major axis is 2 4 AU and the eccentricity 0 54
GALEX observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 using the near ultraviolet (NUV) objective grism were made before during and after the Deep Impact event that occurred on 2005 July 4 at 05 52 03 UT when a 370 kg NASA spacecraft was maneuvered into the path of the comet The NUV channel provides usable spectral information in a bandpass covering 2000 - 3400 A with a point source spectral resolving power of approximately 100
The primary spectral features in this range include solar continuum scattered from cometary dust and emissions from OH and CS molecular bands centered near 3085 and 2575 A respectively In particular we report the only cometary CS emission detected during this event The observations allow the evolution of these spectral features to be tracked over the period of the encounter
In general the NUV emissions observed from Tempel 1 are much fainter than those that have been observed by GALEX from other comets However it is possible to derive production rates for the parent molecules of the species detected by GALEX in Tempel 1 and to determine the number of these molecules liberated by the impact
We have used four telescopes at different longitudes to obtain near-continuous lightcurve coverage of the star HD 80606 as it was transited by its \sim 4-MJup planet The observations were performed during the predicted transit windows around the 25th of October 2008 and the 14th of February 2009 Our data set is unique in that it simultaneously constrains the duration of the transit and the planet&#39;s period
Numerous nearby FGK dwarfs possess discs of debris generated by collisions among comets Here we fit the levels of dusty excess observed by Spitzer at 70$\umu$m and show that they form a rather smooth distribution Taking into account the transition of the dust removal process from collisional to Poynting-Robertson drag
all the stars may be empirically fitted by a single population with many low-excess members Within this ensemble the Kuiper Belt is inferred to be such a low-dust example among the last 10% of stars with a small cometary population Analogue systems hosting gas giant planets and a modest comet belt should occur for only a few per cent of Sun-like stars
A material exists which links together the influx of meteoritic matter from interplanetary space the polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) the sporadic sodium layers the polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs NLCs) and the observed ion chemistry in the mesosphere The evidence in these research fields is here analyzed and found to agree well with the properties of Rydberg Matter (RM)
This material has been studied with numerous methods in the laboratory Alkali atoms mainly Na reach the mesosphere in the form of interplanetary (meteoritic cometary) dust The planar RM clusters NaN usually contain N = 19 37 or 61 atoms and have the density of air at 90 km altitude where they float
The diameters of the clusters are 10-100 nm from laboratory high precision radio frequency spectroscopic studies Such experiments show that RM clusters interact strongly with radar frequencies this explains the radio frequency heating and reflection studies of PMSE layers The clusters give the low temperature in the mesosphere by efficient selective radiation at long wavelengths
which is observed in RF emission experiments The lowest possible stable temperature of the mesopause is calculated for the first time to be 121 K in agreement with measurements based on the strong optical activity at long wavelengths in RM Sporadic sodium layers are explained in a unique way as due to shockwaves in the RM layers
Due to the high electronic excitation energy in RM clusters they induce efficient reactions forming ions of all atoms and molecules in the atmosphere thus providing condensation nuclei for water vapour This finally gives the visible part of the PMC structure The present contribution fills the gap between and partially replaces the separate theories used to describe the various aspects of these intriguing phenomena
Gravitational microlensing occurs when a foreground star happens to pass very close to our line of sight to a more distant background star The foreground star acts as a lens splitting the light from the source star into two images which are typically unresolved However these images are also magnified
by an amount that depends on the angular lens-source separation The relative lens-source motion results in a time-variable source magnification a microlensing event If the foreground star happens to host a planet with projected separation near the paths of these images the planet will further perturb the images resulting in a characteristic
short-lived signature of the planet This chapter provides an introduction to the discovery and characterization of exoplanets with gravitational microlensing The theoretical foundation of the method is reviewed focusing on the phenomenology of planetary perturbations The strengths and weaknesses of the microlensing technique are discussed highlighting the fact that it is sensitive to low-mass planets with separations just beyond the snow line
orbiting stars located throughout the Galactic disk and foreground bulge An overview of the practice of microlensing planet searches is given with a discussion of some of the challenges with detecting and analyzing planetary perturbations The chapter concludes with a review of the results that have been obtained to date
and a discussion of the near and long-term prospects for microlensing planet surveys Ultimately microlensing is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systems containing analogs of all the solar system planets except Mercury as well as to free floating planets and will provide a crucial test of planet formation theories by determining the demographics of planets throughout the Galaxy
The fact that the Centaurs are the primary source of the Short Period Comets is well established However the origin of the Centaurs themselves is still under some debate with a variety of different source reservoirs being proposed in the last decade In this work we suggest that the Neptune Trojans (together with the Jovian Trojans) could represent an additional significant source of Centaurs
Using dynamical simulations of the first Neptune Trojan discovered (2001 QR322) together with integrations following the evolution of clouds of theoretical Neptune Trojans obtained during simulations of planetary migration we show that the Neptune Trojan population contains a great number of objects which are unstable on both Myr and Gyr timescales
Using individual examples we show how objects that leave the Neptunian Trojan cloud evolve onto orbits indistinguishable from those of the known Centaurs before providing a range of estimates of the flux from this region to the Centaur population With only moderate assumptions it is shown that the Trojans can contribute a significant proportion of the Centaur population
The origins of irregular satellites of the giant planets are an important piece of the giant &#34;puzzle&#34; that is the theory of Solar System formation It is well established that they are not &#34;in situ&#34; formation objects around the planet as are believed to be the regular ones Then the most plausible hypothesis to explain their origins is that they formed elsewhere and were captured by the planet
However captures under restricted three-body problem dynamics have temporary feature which makes necessary the action of an auxiliary capture mechanism Nevertheless there not exist one well established capture mechanism In this work we tried to understand which aspects of a binary-asteroid capture mechanism could favor the permanent capture of one member of a binary asteroid
We performed more than eight thousand numerical simulations of capture trajectories considering the four-body dynamical system Sun Jupiter Binary-asteroid We restricted the problem to the circular planar prograde case and time of integration to 10^4 years With respect to the binary features we noted that 1) tighter binaries are much more susceptible to produce permanent captures than the large separation-ones
We also found that 2) the permanent capture probability of the minor member of the binary is much more expressive than the major body permanent capture probability On the other hand among the aspects of capture-disruption process 4) a pseudo eastern-quadrature was noted to be a very likely capture angular configuration at the instant of binary disruptions
The class of exotic Jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to their parent stars were not explicitly expected before their discovery The recently found transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass Mp = 1 4(+/-0 1) Jupiter masses (MJ) a mean orbital distance of only 3 1 stellar radii (meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces)
and a period of 1 1 days Its radius 1 79(+/- 0 09) RJ is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0 049(+/-0 015) is even more surprising as such close orbits are in general quickly circularized Here we report an analysis of its properties which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate ~ 10^-7 MJ yr^-1
The planets surface is distorted by the stars gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet We conclude that dissipation of the stars tidal perturbation in the planets convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume
Forty years ago Apollo astronauts placed the first of several retroreflector arrays on the lunar surface Their continued usefulness for laser-ranging might suggest that the lunar environment does not damage optical devices However new laser ranging data reveal that the efficiency of the three Apollo reflector arrays is now diminished by a factor of ten at all lunar phases and by an additional factor of ten when the lunar phase is near full moon
These deficits did not exist in the earliest years of lunar ranging indicating that the lunar environment damages optical equipment on the timescale of decades Dust or abrasion on the front faces of the corner-cube prisms may be responsible reducing their reflectivity and degrading their thermal performance when exposed to face-on sunlight at full moon
Although the Earth&#39;s orbit is never far from circular terrestrial planets around other stars might experience substantial changes in eccentricity that could lead to climate changes including possible &#34;phase transitions&#34; such as the snowball transition (or its opposite) There is evidence that Earth has gone through at least one globally frozen
&#34;snowball&#34; state in the last billion years which it is thought to have exited after several million years because global ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle thereby allowing greenhouse gases to build up to sufficient concentration to melt the ice Due to the positive feedback caused by the high albedo of snow and ice
susceptibility to falling into snowball states might be a generic feature of water-rich planets with the capacity to host life This paper has two main thrusts First we revisit one-dimensional energy balance climate models as tools for probing possible climates of exoplanets investigate the dimensional scaling of such models and introduce a simple algorithm to treat the melting of the ice layer on a globally-frozen planet
We show that if a terrestrial planet undergoes Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity that are of great enough magnitude it could melt out of a snowball state Second we examine the kinds of variations of eccentricity that a terrestrial planet might experience due to the gravitational influence of a giant companion
We show that a giant planet on a sufficiently eccentric orbit can excite extreme eccentricity oscillations in the orbit of a habitable terrestrial planet More generally these two results demonstrate that the longterm habitability (and astronomical observables) of a terrestrial planet can depend on the detailed architecture of the planetary system in which it resides
We present Spitzer MIPS observations at 24 um of 37 solar-type stars in the Pleiades and combine them with previous observations to obtain a sample of 71 stars We report that 23 stars or 32 +/- 6 8% have excesses at 24 um at least 10% above their photospheric emission
We compare our results with studies of debris disks in other open clusters and with a study of A stars to show that debris disks around solar-type stars at 115 Myr occur at nearly the same rate as around A-type stars We analyze the effects of binarity and X-ray activity on the excess flux
Stars with warm excesses tend not to be in equal-mass binary systems possibly due to clearing of planetesimals by binary companions in similar orbits We find that the apparent anti-correlations in the incidence of excess and both the rate of stellar rotation and also the level of activity as judged by X-ray emission are statistically weak
We perform numerical calculations of the expected transit timing variations (TTVs) induced on a Hot-Jupiter by an Earth-mass perturber Motivated by the recent discoveries of retrograde transiting planets we concentrate on an investigation of the effect of varying relative planetary inclinations up to and including completely retrograde systems We find that planets in low order (E
g 2 1) mean-motion resonances (MMRs) retain approximately constant TTV amplitudes for $0&lt;\ ^{\circ}i&lt;170\ ^{\circ}$ only reducing in amplitude for $i &gt; 170\ ^{\circ}$ Systems in higher order MMRs (E g 5 1) increase in TTV amplitude as inclinations increase towards $45\ ^{\circ}$ becoming approximately constant for $45 &lt; i &lt; 135$
and then declining for $i &gt; 135\ ^{\circ}$ Planets away from resonance slowly decrease in TTV amplitude as inclinations increase from 0 to 180 where-as planets adjacent to resonances can exhibit a huge range of variability in TTV amplitude as a function of both eccentricity and inclination For highly retrograde systems ($135\
^{\circ} &lt; i \leq 180\ ^{\circ}$) TTV signals will be undetectable across almost the entirety of parameter space with the exceptions occurring when the perturber has high eccentricity or is very close to a MMR This high inclination decrease in TTV amplitude (on and away from resonance) is important for the analysis of the known retrograde and multi-planet transiting systems
We report the observation of a cloud system on Titan that remained localized near 40S latitude and 60W longitude for at least 34 hours Ground-based observations obtained with the SINFONI imaging spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope over 4 consecutive nights recorded the lifetime and altitude of the unresolved cloud system
Concomitant measurements made by Cassini/VIMS over 3 hours resolved changes in the altitude and opacity of individual regions within the system during this time Clouds are measured from 13 to 37 km altitude with optical depths per pixel ranging from $\tau$=0 13 to 7 Short timescale rise times are consistent with previous measurements of the evolution of mid-latitude clouds; however the long timescale localization of the cloud structure is unexplained
There is a remarkable synergy between requirements for Dark Energy probes by cosmic shear measurements and planet hunting by microlensing Employing weak and strong gravitational lensing to trace and detect the distribution of matter on cosmic and Galactic scales but as well as to the very small scales of exoplanets is a unique meeting point from cosmology to exoplanets
It will use gravity as the tool to explore the full range of masses not accessible by any other means EUCLID is a 1 2m telescope with optical and IR wide field imagers and slitless spectroscopy proposed to ESA Cosmic Vision to probe for Dark Energy Baryonic acoustic oscillation galaxy evolution
and an exoplanet hunt via microlensing A 3 months microlensing program will already efficiently probe for planets down to the mass of Mars at the snow line for free floating terrestrial or gaseous planets and habitable super Earth A 12+ months survey would give a census on habitable Earth planets around solar like stars
We report on observations of the dust trail of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) in visible light with the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2 2m telescope at 4 7 AU before aphelion and at 24 micron with the MIPS instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope at 5 7 AU both before and after aphelion
The comet did not appear to be active during our observations Our images probe large dust grains emitted from the comet that have a radiation pressure parameter beta&lt;0 01 We compare our observations with simulated images generated with a dynamical model of the cometary dust and constrain the emission speeds
size distribution production rate and geometric albedo of the dust We achieve the best fit to our data with a differential size distribution exponent of -4 1 and emission speeds for a beta=0 01 particle of 25 m/s at perihelion and 2 m/s at 3 AU The dust production rate in our model is on the order of 1000 kg/s at perihelion and 1 kg/s at 3 AU
and we require a dust geometric albedo between 0 022 and 0 044 The production rates of large (&gt;10 micron) particles required to reproduce the brightness of the trail are sufficient to also account for the coma brightness observed while the comet was inside 3 AU and we infer that the cross-section in the coma of CG may be dominated by grains of the order of 60-600 micron
Extrasolar planetary host stars are enriched in key planet-building elements These enrichments have the potential to drastically alter the building blocks available for terrestrial planet formation Here we report on the combination of dynamical models of late-stage terrestrial planet formation within known extrasolar planetary systems with chemical equilibrium models of the composition of solid material within the disk
This allows us to constrain the bulk elemental composition of extrasolar terrestrial planets A wide variety of resulting planetary compositions exist ranging from those that are essentially &#34;Earth-like&#34; containing metallic Fe and Mg-silicates to those that are dominated by graphite and SiC This implies that a diverse range of terrestrial planets are likely to exist within extrasolar planetary systems
We report the discovery of two new short-period variable stars in the Lyra constellation GSC2 3 N208000326 and GSC2 3 N20B000251 observed at the Astronomical Observatory of Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley Photometric measurements collected during several days are presented and discussed One star appears to be a delta Scuti pulsating star (P=0
probable spectral type F2) Th identity of the second star (P=0 402714+/-0 000008 days) resulted more difficult to be understood We propose that this object should be classified as an eclipsing binary system where 0 065 and 0 055 are respectively the depths of the primary and secondary minimum in the light curve
The ever-expanding catalog of detected super-Earths calls for theoretical studies of their properties in the case of a substantial water layer This work considers such water planets with a range of masses and water mass fractions (2 to 5 M_Earth 0 02% to 50% H2 O) First we model the thermal and dynamical structure of the near-surface for icy and oceanic surfaces
finding separate regimes where the planet is expected to maintain a subsurface liquid ocean and where it is expected to exhibit ice tectonics Newly discovered exoplanets may be placed into one of these regimes given estimates of surface temperature heat flux and gravity Second we construct a parameterized convection model for the underlying ice mantle of higher ice phases
finding that materials released from the silicate iron core should traverse the ice mantle on the timescale of 0 1 to 100 megayears We present the dependence of the overturn times of the ice mantle and the planetary radius on total mass and water mass fraction Finally we discuss the implications of these internal processes on atmospheric observables
We study the collisional evolution of km-sized planetesimals in tight binary star systems to investigate whether accretion towards protoplanets can proceed despite the strong gravitational perturbations from the secondary star The orbits of planetesimals are numerically integrated in two dimensions under the influence of the two stars and gas drag
The masses and orbits of the planetesimals are allowed to evolve due to collisions with other planetesimals and accretion of collisional debris In addition the mass in debris can evolve due to planetesimal-planetesimal collisions and the creation of new planetesimals We show that it is possible in principle for km-sized planetesimals to grow by two orders of magnitude in size if the efficiency of planetesimal formation is relatively low
(Abridged) Thirty-three objects with possible origins beyond the Kuiper Belt edge very high inclinations very large semi-major axes or large perihelion distances were observed to determine their surface colors All three objects that have been dynamically linked to the inner Oort cloud (Sedna 2006 SQ372 and 2000 OO67) were found to have ultra-red surfaces (S~25)
Ultra-red material is generally associated with rich organics and the low inclination &#34;cold&#34; classical Kuiper Belt objects The observations detailed here show very red material may be a more general feature for objects kept far from the Sun The recently discovered retrograde outer Solar System objects (2008 KV42 and 2008 YB3) and the high inclination object (127546) 2002 XU93 show only moderately red surfaces (S~9)
very similar to known comets The extended or detached disk objects which have large perihelion distances and large eccentricities are found to have mostly moderately red colors (10 &lt; S &lt; 18) The colors of the detached disk objects including the dynamically unusual 2004 XR190 and 2000 CR105 are similar to the scattered disk and Plutino populations
Thus the detached and scattered disk likely have a similar mix of objects from the same source regions Outer classical belt objects including 1995 TL8 were found to have very red surfaces (18 &lt; S &lt; 30) The &#34;cold&#34; classical belt outer classical belt and inner Oort cloud appear to be dominated by ultra-red objects (S &gt; 25) and thus don&#39;t likely have a similar mix of objects as the scattered disk
Recent high-precision measurements of the isotopic composition of lunar rocks demonstrate that the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon show an unexpectedly high degree of similarity This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of classic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the formation of the Moon
namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from the impactor not Earth <br>Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the giant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor material after the impact for a wide range of elements including O Si
K Ti Nd and W Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity it is unlikely to work for the much heavier refractory elements Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these geochemical data alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be explored In this paper
we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed directly from terrestrial mantle material We show that the dynamics of this scenario requires a large amount of energy almost instantaneously generated additional energy The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear fission We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of terrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths core-mantle boundary (CMB)
We study the fate of internal gravity waves which are excited by tidal forcing by a short-period planet at the interface of convection and radiation zones approaching the centre of a solar-type star We study at what amplitude these wave are subject to instabilities These instabilities lead to wave breaking whenever the amplitude exceeds a critical value
Below this value the wave reflects perfectly from the centre of the star Wave breaking results in spinning up the central regions of the star and the formation of a critical layer which acts as an absorbing barrier for ingoing waves As these waves are absorbed the star is spun up from the inside out
This results in an important amplitude dependence of the tidal quality factor Q&#39; If the tidal forcing amplitude exceeds the value required for wave breaking efficient dissipation results over a continuous range of tidal frequencies leading to Q&#39; \approx 10^5 (P/1day)^(8/3) for the current Sun This varies by less than a factor of 5 throughout the range of G and K type main sequence stars
for a given orbit We predict fewer giant planets with orbital periods of less than about 2 days around such stars if they cause breaking at the centre due to the efficiency of this process This mechanism would however be ineffective in stars with a convective core such as WASP-18
The wind-driven hopping motion of sand grains known as saltation forms dunes and ripples and ejects fine dust particles into the atmosphere on both Earth and Mars While the wind speed at which saltation is initiated the fluid threshold has been studied extensively the wind speed at which it is halted
the impact threshold has been poorly quantified for Mars conditions We present an analytical model of the impact threshold which we show to be in agreement with measurements and recent numerical simulations for Earth conditions For Mars conditions we find that the impact threshold is approximately an order of magnitude below the fluid threshold
in agreement with previous studies Saltation on Mars can thus be sustained at wind speeds an order of magnitude less than required to initiate it leading to the occurrence of hysteresis These results confirm earlier simulations with a detailed numerical saltation model and have important implications for the formation of sand dunes
We present simulations of atmospheres of Earth-like aquaplanets that are tidally locked to their star that is planets whose orbital period is equal to the rotation period about their spin axis so that one side always faces the star and the other side is always dark As extreme cases illustrating the effects of slow and rapid rotation
we consider planets with rotation periods equal to one current Earth year and one current Earth day The dynamics responsible for the surface climate (e g winds temperature precipitation) and the general circulation of the atmosphere are discussed in light of existing theories of atmospheric circulations For example as expected from the increasing importance of Coriolis accelerations relative to inertial accelerations as the rotation rate increases
the winds are approximately isotropic and divergent at leading order in the slowly rotating atmosphere but are predominantly zonal and rotational in the rapidly rotating atmosphere Free-atmospheric horizontal temperature variations in the slowly rotating atmosphere are generally weaker than in the rapidly rotating atmosphere Interestingly the surface temperature on the night side of the planets does not fall below ~240 K in either the rapidly or slowly rotating atmosphere; that is
heat transport from the day side to the night side of the planets efficiently reduces temperature contrasts in either case Rotational waves shape the distribution of winds temperature and precipitation in the rapidly rotating atmosphere; in the slowly rotating atmosphere these distributions are controlled by simpler divergent circulations The results are of interest in the study of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets and as illustrations of how planetary rotation and the insolation distribution shape climate
An explosion on comet 17P/Holmes occurred on 2007 Oct 23 projecting particulate debris of a wide range of sizes into the interplanetary medium We observed the comet using the Spitzer spectrograph on 2007 Nov 10 and 2008 Feb 27 and the photometer on 2008 Mar 13 The fresh ejecta have detailed mineralogical features from small crystalline silicate grains
The 2008 Feb 27 spectra and the central core of the 2007 Nov 10 spectral map reveal nearly featureless spectra due to much larger grains that were ejected from the nucleus more slowly We break the infrared image into three components (size speed) that also explain the temporal evolution of the mm-wave flux
Optical images were obtained on multiple dates spanning 2007 Oct 27 to 2008 Mar 10 at the Holloway Comet Observatory and 1 5-m telescope at Palomar Observatory The orientation of the leading edge of the ejecta shell and the ejecta blob relative to the nucleus do not change as the orientation of the Sun changes; instead
the configuration was imprinted by the orientation of the initial explosion The kinetic energy of the ejecta &gt;1e21 erg is greater than the gravitational binding energy of the nucleus We model the explosion as being due to crystallization and release of volatiles from interior amorphous ice within a subsurface cavity; once the pressure in the cavity exceeded the surface strength
the material above the cavity was propelled from the comet The size of the cavity and the tensile strength of the upper layer of the nucleus are constrained by the observed properties of the ejecta; tensile strengths on &gt;10 m scale must be greater than 10 kPa The appearance of the 2007 outburst is similar to that witnessed in 1892
{Abridged} An analysis of the calcium and hydrogen abundances Galactic positions and kinematics of 146 DZ stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey demonstrates that interaction with the interstellar medium cannot account for their externally polluted atmospheres The calcium-to-hydrogen ratios for the 37 DZA stars are dominated by super-solar values
as are the lower limits for the remaining 109 DZ stars All together their metal-contaminated convective envelopes contain 10^{20+-2} g of calcium commensurate with the masses of calcium inferred for large asteroids It is probable that these stars are contaminated by circumstellar matter; the rocky remains of terrestrial planetary systems
Planetary migration in standard models of gaseous protoplanetary disks is known to be very rapid ($\sim 10^5$ years) jeopardizing the existence of planetary systems We present a new mechanism for significantly slowing rapid planetary migration discovered by means of radiative transfer calculations of the thermal structure of protoplanetary disks irradiated by their central stars
Rapid dust settling in a disk&#39;s dead zone - a region with very little turbulence - leaves a dusty wall at its outer edge We show that the back-heating of the dead zone by this irradiated wall produces a positive gradient of the disk temperature which acts as a thermal barrier to planetary migration which persists for the disk lifetime
Although we analyze in detail the migration of a Super-Earth in a low mass disk around an M star our findings can apply to wide variety of young planetary systems We compare our findings with other potentially important stopping mechanisms and show that there are large parameter spaces for which dead zones are likely to play the most important role for reproducing the observed mass-period relation in longer planetary periods
[Abridged] We consider the dynamics of a system of hot super-Earths or Neptunes such as HD 40307 We show that as tidal interaction with the central star leads to small eccentricities the planets in this system could be undergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly from very precise commensurability
In a three planet system this is indicated by the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term changes to the orbital elements We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were in a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc After entering the disc inner cavity
tidal interaction would cause the period ratios to increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer pair counter to what occurs in HD 40307 However the relationship between these pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is impulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the planetary system decouples from the disc
We find this to be in principle possible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1 d-3 but then we find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible only if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal dissipation is very effective
On the other hand we found that a system like HD 40307 with minimum masses and more realistic tidal dissipation could be produced if the eccentricity of the outermost planet was impulsively increased to about 0 15 The form of resonantly coupled tidal evolution we consider here is quite general and could be of greater significance for systems with inner planets on significantly shorter orbital periods characteristic of for example CoRoT 7 b
Detection of molecules using infrared spectroscopy probes the conditions and compositions of exoplanet atmospheres Water (H2O) methane (CH4) carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been detected in two hot Jupiters These previous results relied on space-based telescopes that do not provide spectroscopic capability in the 2 4 - 5
Here we report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD 189733b between 2 0-2 4 micron and 3 1-4 1 micron where we find a bright emission feature Where overlap with space-based instruments exists our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements A feature at ~3 25 micron is unexpected and difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1 bar to 1 x 10-6 bar pressures typically sampled by infrared measurements
We present an occultation of the newly discovered hot Jupiter system WASP-19 observed with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT in order to measure thermal emission from the planet&#39;s dayside at ~2 um The light curve was analysed using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method to find the eclipse depth and the central transit time
The transit depth was found to be 0 366+-0 072 % corresponding to a brightness temperature of 2540+-180 K This is significantly higher than the calculated (zero-albedo) equilibrium temperature and indicates that the planet shows poor redistribution of heat to the night side consistent with models of highly irradiated planets
The topic of this paper is to study the two way time-transfer problem between a ground based station and a low orbit Earth&#39;s satellite in the aim of an application to the T2L2 experiment The sudy is driven in a fully relativistic framework Because of the rapid increase in clock&#39;s precision/measurements
Local shearing box simulations of stratified magneto rotational turbulence invariably exhibit cyclic field patterns which propagate away from the disc midplane A common explanation for this is magnetic buoyancy The recent analysis by Shi et al however shows that the flow is buoyantly stable below one disc scale height H
necessitating an alternative explanation in this region We here conduct and analyse direct numerical simulations to explain the observed behaviour by means of a mean-field description Apart from the mean radial and azimuthal field we monitor the small-scale current helicity which we propose as a key indicator for saturation Reconstructing the horizontally averaged field
we demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a one-dimensional induction equation By means of the so-called test field method we then determine the underlying closure parameters Our analysis shows that apart from a possible direct MRI dynamo two distinct indirect dynamo mechanisms operate in the disc This resolves the issue of the &#34;wrong&#34; sign of the MRI dynamo effect
Finally we use the obtained closure parameters to run a dynamically quenched dynamo model This model approximately recovers the observed field patterns in the mean fields Moreover the model reproduces the prevailing parity and the distinct phase pattern in the small-scale current helicity The latter property might open a potential route to understand the saturation of MRI induced turbulence
We carry out 2-D high resolution numerical simulations of type I planet migration with different disk viscosities We find that the planet migration is strongly dependent on disk viscosities Two kinds of density wave damping mechanisms are discussed Accordingly the angular momentum transport can be either viscosity dominated or shock dominated
Precise radial-velocity measurements for data acquired with the HARPS spectrograph infer that three planets orbit the M4 dwarf star GJ876 In particular we confirm the existence of planet &#34;d&#34; which orbits every 1 93785 days We find that its orbit may have significant eccentricity (e=0 14) and deduce a more accurate estimate of its minimum mass of 6
Dynamical modeling of the HARPS measurements combined with literature velocities from the Keck Observatory strongly constrain the orbital inclinations of the &#34;b&#34; and &#34;c&#34; planets We find that i_b = 48 9 degrees and i_c = 48 1 degrees which infers the true planet masses of M_b = 2 64 Jupiter masses and M_c = 0
respectively Radial velocities alone in this favorable case can therefore fully determine the orbital architecture of a multi-planet system without the input from astrometry or transits <br>The orbits of the two giant planets are nearly coplanar and their 2 1 mean motion resonance ensures stability over at least 5 Gyr
The libration amplitude is smaller than 2 degrees suggesting that it was damped by some dissipative process during planet formation The system has space for a stable fourth planet in a 4 1 mean motion resonance with planet &#34;b&#34; with a period around 15 days The radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of this possible additional planet to be at most that of the Earth
This contribution is a first step aiming to address a general question what can be concluded on impact craters which exist on various planetary system objects by combining astronomical data and known theoretical results from solid state physics Assuming that the material of the target body is of crystaline structure
it is shown that a simple calculation gives the possibility of estimating the speed of the impactor responsible for the creation of a crater A test value calculated using observed data on the composition of some asteroids gives a value of the speed in good agreement with results of celestial mechanics
We report here the first infrared spectrum of the hot-Jupiter XO-1b The observations were obtained with NICMOS instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope during a primary eclipse of the XO-1 system Near photon-noise-limited spectroscopy between 1 2 and 1 8 micron allows us to determine the main composition of this hot-Jupiter&#39;s planetary atmosphere with good precision
This is the third hot-Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere for which spectroscopic data are available in the near IR The spectrum shows the presence of water vapor (H2O) methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and suggests the possible presence of carbon monoxide (CO) We show that the published IRAC secondary transit emission photometric data are compatible with the atmospheric composition at the terminator determined from the NICMOS spectrum
with a range of possible mixing-ratios and thermal profiles; additional emission spectroscopy data are needed to reduce the degeneracy of the possible solutions Finally we note the similarity between the 1 2-1 8 micron transmission spectra of XO-1b and HD 209458b suggesting that in addition to having similar stellar/orbital and planetary parameters the two systems may also have a similar exoplanetary atmospheric composition
We use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron magnesium and silicon chemistry in the atmospheres of giant planets brown dwarfs extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and low-mass stars The behavior of individual Fe- Mg- and Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined as a function of temperature pressure and metallicity Our results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere
The condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) cloud formation
Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs whereas SiH4 is dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets
The presence of a body in an orbit around a close eclipsing binary star manifests itself through the light time effect influencing the observed times of eclipses as the close binary and the circumbinary companion both move around the common centre of mass This fact combined with the periodicity with which the eclipses occur can be used to detect the companion
Given a sufficient precision of the times of eclipses the eclipse timing can be employed to detect substellar or even planetary mass companions <br>The main goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of the photometry based eclipse timing of binary stars as a method of detecting circumbinary planets
In the models we assume that the companion orbits a binary star in a circular Keplerian orbit We analyze both the space and ground based photometry cases In particular we study the usefulness of the on-going COROT and Kepler missions in detecting circumbinary planets We also explore the relations binding the planet discovery space with the physical parameters of the binaries and the geometrical parameters of their light curves
We carry out detailed numerical simulations of the eclipse timing by employing a relatively realistic model of the light curves of eclipsing binary stars We study the influence of the white and red photometric noises on the timing precision We determine the sensitivity of the eclipse timing technique to circumbinary planets for the ground and space based photometric observations
The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) monitors fields of up to ~1000 stars at 5 Hz simultaneously with four small telescopes to detect occultation events from small (~1 km) Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) The survey presents a number of challenges in particular the fact that the occultation events we are searching for are extremely rare and are typically manifested as slight flux drops for only one or two consecutive time series measurements
The main goal of the Pennsylvania - Torun Planet Search (PTPS) is detection and characterization of planets around evolved stars using the high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) technique The project is performed with the 9 2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope To determine stellar parameters and evolutionary status for targets observed within the survey complete spectral analysis of all objects is required
In this paper we present the atmospheric parameters (effective temperatures surface gravities microturbulent velocities and metallicities) of a subsample of Red Giant Clump stars using strictly spectroscopic methods based on analysis of equivalent widths of Fe I and Fe II lines It is shown that our spectroscopic approach brings reliable and consistent results
Astrophysical false positives due to stellar eclipsing binaries pose one of the greatest challenges to ground-based surveys for transiting Hot Jupiters We have used known properties of multiple star systems and Hot Jupiter systems to predict a priori the number of such false detections and the number of genuine planet detections recovered in two hypothetical but realistic ground-based transit surveys targeting fields close to the galactic plane (b~10 degrees)
a shallow survey covering a magnitude range 10&lt;V&lt;13 and a deep survey covering a magnitude range 15&lt;V&lt;19 Our results are consistent with the commonly-reported experience of false detections outnumbering planet detections by a factor of ~10 in shallow surveys while in our synthetic deep survey we find ~1-2 false detections for every planet detection
We characterize the eclipsing binary configurations that are most likely to cause false detections and find that they can be divided into three main types (i) two dwarfs undergoing grazing transits (ii) two dwarfs undergoing low-latitude transits in which one component has a substantially smaller radius than the other and (iii) two eclipsing dwarfs blended with one or more physically unassociated foreground stars
We also predict that a significant fraction of Hot Jupiter detections are blended with the light from other stars showing that care must be taken to identify the presence of any unresolved neighbors in order to obtain accurate estimates of planetary radii This issue is likely to extend to terrestrial planet candidates in the CoRoT and Kepler transit surveys
The effects of multi-layered clouds in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets orbiting different types of stars are studied The radiative effects of cloud particles are directly correlated with their wavelength-dependent optical properties Therefore the incident stellar spectra may play an important role for the climatic effect of clouds We discuss the influence of clouds with mean properties measured in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere on the surface temperatures and Bond albedos of Earth-like planets orbiting different types of main sequence dwarf stars
Context Current models of the size- and radial evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of the disk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models) or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or without fragmentation Further studies of protoplanetary disks - such as observations
disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models - depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radial position in the disk <br>Aims We attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate how the initial conditions the build-up phase and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust
<br>Methods We introduce a new version of the model of Brauer et al (2008) in which we now include the time-dependent viscous evolution of the gas disk and in which more advanced input physics and numerical integration methods are implemented <br>Results We show that grain properties the gas pressure gradient
and the amount of turbulence are much more influencing the evolution of dust than the initial conditions or the build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk We quantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond the meter size barrier High gas surface densities or zonal flows may help to overcome the problem of radial drift
For planets other than Earth interpretation of the composition and structure depends largely on comparing the mass and radius with the composition expected given their distance from the parent star The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth
We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably well established and for differentiated Fe/rock We find that variations in the equation of state such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure data
can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations and on planetary pressure profiles The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets Kepler-10b is apparently &#39;Earth- like &#39; likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth&#39;s nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet
CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth&#39;s GJ 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4 suggesting an &#39;icy&#39; composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation
which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1
We present a new magnetohydrodynamic mechanism for inflation of close-in giant extrasolar planets The idea behind the mechanism is that current which is induced through interaction of atmospheric winds and the planetary magnetic field results in significant Ohmic dissipation of energy in the interior We develop an analytical model for computation of interior Ohmic dissipation
with a simplified treatment of the atmosphere We apply our model to HD209458b Tres-4b and HD189733b With conservative assumptions for wind speed and field strength our model predicts a generated power that appears to be large enough to maintain the transit radii opening an unexplored avenue towards solving a decade-old puzzle of extrasolar gas giant radius anomalies
We have used Spitzer and its IRAC camera to search for the transit of the super-Earth HD 40307b The transiting nature of the planet could not be firmly discarded from our first photometric monitoring of a transit window because of the uncertainty coming from the modeling of the photometric baseline
To obtain a firm result two more transit windows were observed and a global Bayesian analysis of the three IRAC time series and the HARPS radial velocities was performed Unfortunately any transit of the planet during the observed phase window is firmly discarded while the probability that the planet transits but that the eclipse was missed by our observations is nearly negligible (0
We carry out a series of high resolution ($1024\times 1024$) hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the orbital evolution of Jupiter and Saturn embedded in a gaseous protostellar disk Our work extends the results in the classical papers of Masset &amp; Snellgrove (2001) and Morbidelli &amp; Crida (2007) by exploring various surface density profiles ($\sigma$)
where $\sigma \propto r^{-\alpha}$ The stability of the mean motion resonances(MMRs) caused by the convergent migration of the two planets is studied as well Our results show that (1) The gap formation process of Saturn is greatly delayed by the tidal perturbation of Jupiter These perturbations cause inward or outward runaway migration of Saturn
depending on the density profiles on the disk (2) The convergent migration rate increases as $\alpha$ increases and the type of MMRs depends on $\alpha$ as well When $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ the convergent migration speed of Jupiter and Saturn is relatively slow thus they are trapped into 2 1 MMR When $\alpha&gt;4/3$
Saturn passes through the $2 1$ MMR with Jupiter and is captured into the $3 2$ MMR (3) The $3 2$ MMR turns out to be unstable when the eccentricity of Saturn ($e_s$) increases too high The critical value above which instability will set in is $e_s \sim 0 15$
The scaling of physical forces to the extremely low ambient gravitational acceleration regimes found on the surfaces of small asteroids is performed Resulting from this it is found that van der Waals cohesive forces between regolith grains on asteroid surfaces should be a dominant force and compete with particle weights and be greater
in general than electrostatic and solar radiation pressure forces Based on this scaling we interpret previous experiments performed on cohesive powders in the terrestrial environment as being relevant for the understanding of processes on asteroid surfaces The implications of these terrestrial experiments for interpreting observations of asteroid surfaces and macro-porosity are considered
We present the first ground-based detection of thermal emission from an exoplanet in the H-band Using HAWK-I on the VLT we observed an occultation of WASP-19b by its G8V-type host star WASP-19b is a Jupiter-mass planet with an orbital period of only 19 h and thus being highly irradiated is expected to be hot
We measure an H-band occultation depth of (0 259 +0 046 -0 044) % which corresponds to an H-band brightness temperature of T_H = 2580 +/- 125 K A cloud-free model of the planet&#39;s atmosphere with no redistribution of energy from day-side to night-side under predicts the planet/star flux density ratio by a factor of two
The probability that an exoplanet transits its host star is high for planets in close orbits but drops off rapidly for increasing semimajor axes This makes transit surveys for planets with large semimajor axes orbiting bright stars impractical since one would need to continuously observe hundreds of stars that are spread out over the entire sky
One way to make such a survey tractable is to constrain the inclination of the stellar rotation axes in advance and thereby enhance the transit probabilities We derive transit probabilities for stars with stellar inclination constraints considering a reasonable range of planetary system inclinations We find that stellar inclination constraints can improve the transit probability by almost an order of magnitude for habitable-zone planets
When applied to an ensemble of stars such constraints dramatically lower the number of stars that need to be observed in a targeted transit survey We also consider multiplanet systems where only one planet has an identified transit and derive the transit probabilities for the second planet assuming a range of mutual planetary inclinations
An analysis is made of the manner in which the cosmic ray intensity at Earth has varied over its existence and its possible relevance to both the origin and the evolution of life Much of the analysis relates to the &#39;high energy&#39; cosmic rays ($E&gt;10^{14}eV;=0 1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing proximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally believed to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies
It is pointed out that on a statistical basis there will have been considerable variations in the likely 100 My between the Earth&#39;s biosphere reaching reasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life Interestingly there is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are responsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the possibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and thereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the &#39;building blocks of life&#39;
Attention is also given to the well known generation of the oxides of nitrogen by lightning strokes which are poisonous to animal life but helpful to plant growth; here too the violent swings of cosmic ray intensities may have had relevance to evolutionary changes A particular variant of the cosmic ray acceleration model
put forward by us predicts an increase in lightning rate in the past and this has been sought in Korean historical records Finally the time dependence of the overall cosmic ray intensity which manifests itself mainly at sub-10 GeV energies has been examined The relevance of cosmic rays to the &#39;global electrical circuit&#39; points to the importance of this concept
GJ 436b is the first extrasolar planet discovered that resembles Neptune in mass and radius The particularly interesting property of Neptune-sized planets is that their mass Mp and radius Rp are close to theoretical M-R relations of water planets Given Mp Rp and equilibrium temperature however various internal compositions are possible
A broad set of interior structure models is presented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and possible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets such as GJ 436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density We show how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints from formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational constraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2
We model the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope water layer rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope rocky core) For water we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations Some admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius For the warmest considered models
the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3 still extending over ~0 7 REarth If water occurs it will be essentially in the plasma phase or in the superionic phase but not in an ice phase Metal-free envelope models have 0 02&lt;k2&lt;0 2 and the core mass cannot be determined from a measurement of k2
In contrast models with 0 3&lt;k2&lt;0 82 require high metallicities Z1&lt;0 89 in the outer envelope The uncertainty in core mass decreases to 0 4 Mp if k2&gt;0 3 and further to 0 2 Mp if k2&gt;0 5 and core mass and Z1 become sensitive functions of k2 To further narrow the set of solutions
I describe new constraints on the lifetimes and morphologies of transitional protoplanetary disks from observations of 1--10 Myr old stars with the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} New Spitzer results clearly show evidence for two kinds of transitional disks and thus two main disk evolutionary pathways disks which form an inner hole/gap and clear from the inside out and disks that deplete more homologously
Analyzing the disk populations of 1--10 Myr old clusters such as Taurus IC 348 NGC 2362 and $\eta$ Cha show that the mean transitional disk lifetime must be an appreciable fraction of the mean protoplanetary disk lifetime $\approx$ 1 Myr out of 3--5 Myr The varieties of transitional disk SEDs and correlations with other disk diagnostics are consistent with multiple mechanisms responsible for clearing disks
Because the planets of a system form in a flattened disk they are expected to share similar orbital inclinations at the end of their formation The high-precision photometric monitoring of stars known to host a transiting planet could thus reveal the transits of one or more other planets We investigate here the potential of this approach for the M dwarf GJ 1214 that hosts a transiting super-Earth
For this system we infer the transit probabilities as a function of orbital periods Using Monte-Carlo simulations we address both the cases for fully coplanar and for non-coplanar orbits with three different choices of inclinations distribution for the non-coplanar case GJ 1214 reveals to be a very promising target for the considered approach
Because of its small size a ground-based photometric monitoring of this star could detect the transit of a habitable planet as small as the Earth while a space-based monitoring could detect any transiting habitable planet down to the size of Mars The mass measurement of such a small planet would be out of reach for current facilities
Since early work on the stability of the first Neptunian Trojan 2001 QR322 suggested that it was a dynamically stable primordial body it has been assumed this applies to both that object and its more recently discovered brethren However it seems that things are no longer so clear cut In this work
we present the results of detailed dynamical simulations of the orbital behaviour of 2001 QR322 Using an ephemeris for the object that has significantly improved since earlier works we follow the evolution of 19683 test particles placed on orbits within the observational error ellipse of 2001 QR322&#39;s orbit for a period of 1 Gyr
We find that majority of these &#34;clones&#34; of 2001 QR322 are dynamically unstable exhibiting a near-exponential decay from both the Neptunian Trojan cloud (decay halflife ~550 Myr) and the Solar system (decay halflife ~590 Myr) The stability of the object within Neptune&#39;s Trojan cloud is found to be strongly dependent on the initial semi-major axis used
with those objects located at semimajor axis equal or greater than 30 30 AU being significantly less stable than those interior to this value as a result of their having initial libration amplitudes very close to a critical threshold dividing regular and irregular motion located at ~70-75 deg (full extent of angular motion)
This result suggests that if 2001 QR322 is a primordial Neptunian Trojan it must be a representative of a population that was once significantly larger than that we see today and adds weight to the idea that the Neptune Trojans may represent a significant source of objects moving on unstable orbits between the giant planets (the Centaurs)
Context With the increasing knowledge of the terrestrial planets due to recent space probes it is possible to model their rotation with increasing accuracy Despite that fact an accurate determination of Venus precession and nutation is lacking <br>Aims Although Venus rotation has been studied in several aspects a full and precise analytical model of its precession-nutation motion remains to be constructed
We propose to determine this motion with up-to-date physical parameters of the planet <br>Methods We adopt a theoritical framework already used for a precise precession-nutation model of the Earth based on a Hamiltonian formulation canonical equations and an accurate development of the perturbing function due to the Sun <br>Results After integrating the disturbing function and applying the canonical equations
we can evaluate the precession constant $\dot{\Psi}$ and the coefficients of nutation both in longitude and in obliquity We get $\dot{\Psi}=4474&#34; 35/Jcy \pm 66 5 $ corresponding to a precession period of $28965 10 \pm 437$ years This result based on recent estimations of the Venus moment of inertia is significantly different from previous estimations
The largest nutation coefficient in longitude with an argument $2L_{S}$ (where $L_{S}$ is the longitude of the Sun) has a 2&#34;19 amplitude and a 112 35 d period We show that the coefficients of nutation of Venus due to its triaxiality are of the same order of amplitude as these values due to its dynamical flattening
We outline a novel linear instability that may arise in the dead-zones of protostellar disks and possibly the fluid interiors of planets and protoplanets In essence it is an axisymmetric buoyancy instability but one that would not be present in a purely hydrodynamical gas The necessary ingredients for growth include a negative radial entropy gradient (of any magnitude)
weak magnetic fields and efficient resistive diffusion (in comparison with thermal diffusion) The character of the instability is local axisymmetric and double-diffusive and it attacks lengths much shorter than the resistive scale Like the axisymmetric convective instability it draws its energy from the negative radial entropy gradient; but by utilising the diffusing magnetic field
In this Thesis I studied the formation of the four giant planets of the Solar System in the framework of the nucleated instability hypothesis The model considers that solids and gas accretion are coupled in an interactive fashion taking into account detailed constitutive physics for the envelope The accretion rate of the core corresponds to the oligarchic growth regime
We shortly discuss the observable consequences of the two hypotheses about the origin of life on Earth and Mars the Lithopanspermia (Mars to Earth or viceversa) and the origin from a unique progenitor that for Earth is called LUCA (the LUCA hypothesis) To test the possibility that some lifeforms similar to the terrestrial ones may survive on Mars
we designed and built two simulators of Martian environments where to perform experiments with different bacterial strains LISA and mini-LISA Our LISA environmental chambers can reproduce the conditions of many Martian locations near the surface trough changes of temperature pressure UV fluence and atmospheric composition Both simulators are open to collaboration with other laboratories interested in performing experiments on many kind of samples (biological
minerals electronic) in situations similar to that of the red planet Inside LISA we have studied the survival of several bacterial strains and endospores We verified that the UV light is the major responsible of cell death Neither the low temperature nor the pressure nor the desiccation or the atmospheric changes were effective in this sense
We found that some Bacillus strains have a particular capability to survive for some hours in Martian conditions without being screened by dust or other shields We also simulated the coverage happening on a planet by dust transported by the winds blowing on the samples a very small quantity of volcanic ash grains or red iron oxide particles
Much of the surface of Mars is covered by dunes ripples and other features formed by the blowing of sand by wind known as saltation In addition saltation loads the atmosphere with dust aerosols which dominate the Martian climate We show here that saltation can be maintained on Mars by wind speeds an order of magnitude less than required to initiate it
Here we present a photometric and polarimetric study of this object in an attempt to infer additional information about its origin <br>With the FORS1 instrument of the ESO VLT we have performed during the 2007 apparition of 133P/Elst-Pizarro quasi-simultaneous photometry and polarimetry of its nucleus at nine epochs in the phase angle range 0 - 20 deg
For each observing epoch we also combined all available frames to obtain a deep image of the object to seek signatures of weak cometary activity Polarimetric data were analysed by means of a novel physical interference modelling <br>The object brightness was found to be highly variable over timescales &lt;1h a result fully consistent with previous studies
Using the albedo-polarization relationships for asteroids and our photometric results we found for our target an albedo of about 0 06-0 07 and a mean radius of about 1 6 km Throughout the observing epochs our deep imaging of the comet detects a tail and an anti-tail Their temporal variations are consistent with an activity profile starting around mid May 2007 of minimum duration of four months
The apparent source region (or regions) of long-period comets as well as the definition of the dynamically new comet are still open <a href="http //questions The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> aim of this investigation is to look for the apparent source of selected long period comets and to refine the definition of dynamically new comets
We show that incorporation of the non-gravitational forces into the orbit determination process significantly changes the situation We determined precise non-gravitational orbits of all investigated comets and next followed numerically their past and future motion during one orbital period Applying ingenious Sitarski&#39;s method of creating swarms of virtual comets compatible with observations
we were able to derive the uncertainties of original and future orbital elements as well as the uncertainties of the previous and next perihelion distances We concluded that the past and future evolution of cometary orbits under the Galactic tide perturbations is the only way to find which comets are really dynamically new
In the outer regions of the habitable zone the risk of transitioning into a globally frozen &#34;snowball&#34; state poses a threat to the habitability of planets with the capacity to host water-based life We use a one-dimensional energy balance climate model (EBM) to examine how obliquity spin rate orbital eccentricity
and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowball state For an exoplanet these parameters may be strikingly different from the values observed for Earth Since for constant semimajor axis the annual mean stellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2) one might expect the greatest habitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as (1-e^2)^(-1/4)
We find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lower bound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone but the influence of obliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets on eccentric orbits For planets with eccentricity 0 5 our EBM suggests that the greatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0
) depending on obliquity with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable against snowball transitions One might also expect that the long winter at an eccentric planet&#39;s apoastron would render it more susceptible to global freezing Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermal inertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface
Since planets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the star such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for direct observations with missions such as TPF-Darwin Nevertheless the extreme temperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-Earths raise questions about the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitable conditions
The far-infrared (far-IR) spectral window plays host to a wide range of spectroscopic diagnostics with which to study planetary disk systems and exoplanets at wavelengths completely blocked by the Earth atmosphere These include the thermal emission of dusty belts in debris disks the water ice features in the &#34;snow lines&#34; of protoplanetary disks
as well as many key chemical species (O OH H2O NH3 HD etc) These tracers play a critical diagnostic role in a number of key areas including the early stages of planet formation and potentially exoplanets The proposed Japanese-led IR space telescope SPICA with its 3m-class cooled mirror (~5 K) will be the next step in sensitivity after ESA&#39;s Herschel Space Observatory (successfully launched in May 2009)
The mechanism of angular momentum transport in accretion discs has long been debated Although the magnetorotational instability appears to be a promising process poorly ionized regions of accretion discs may not undergo this instability In this letter we revisit the possibility of transporting angular momentum by turbulent thermal convection Using high-resolution spectral methods
we show that strongly turbulent convection can drive outward angular momentum transport at a rate that is under certain conditions compatible with observations of discs We find however that the angular momentum transport is always much weaker than the vertical heat transport These results indicate that convection might be another way to explain global disc evolution
[Abridged] The recent discovery of a transiting planet on a non-circular orbit with a massive highly eccentric companion orbiting HAT-P-13 offers the possibility of probing the structure of the short-period planet The ability to do this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense that the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale
and decay on a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system Since the equilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system parameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet the latter can be determined with accurate measurements of the planet&#39;s eccentricity and radius
However this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the system is coplanar Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point phenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of coplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle with the average value of the eccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with increasing mutual inclination
This behaviour significantly reduces the ability to unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the mutual inclination is higher than around 10^o We show that for Q-values less than 10^6 the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and 126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to quickly move the inclination outside this range
and that the behaviour of retrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems We derive a relationship between the equilibrium radius of the short-period planet its Q-value and its core mass and show that given current estimates of e_b and the planet radius the HAT-P-13 system is likely to be close to coplanar [
We study the type III migration of a Saturn mass planet in low viscosity discs The planet is found to experience cyclic episodes of rapid decay in orbital radius each amounting to a few Hill radii We find this to be due to the scattering of large- scale vortices present in the disc
The origin and role of vortices in the context of type III migration is explored It is shown through numerical simulations and semi- analytical modelling that spiral shocks induced by a sufficiently massive planet will extend close to the planet orbital radius The production of vortensity across shock tips results in thin high vortensity rings with a characteristic width of the local scale height
For planets with masses equal to and above that of Saturn the rings are co-orbital features extending the entire azimuth Linear stability analysis show there exists unstable modes that are localised about local vortensity minima which coincide with gap edges Simulations show that vortices are non-linear a outcome We used hydrodynamic simulations to examine vortex-planet interactions
Their effect is present in discs with kinematic viscosity less than about an order of magnitude smaller than the typically adopted value of \nu = 10^{-5}\Omega_pr_p(0)^2 where r_p(0) and \Omega_p are the initial orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet respectively We find that the magnitude of viscosity affects the nature of type III migration but not the extent of the orbital decay
The role of vortices as a function of initial disc mass is also explored and it is found that the amount of orbital decay during one episode of vortex-planet interaction is independent of initial disc mass We incorporate the concept of the co-orbital mass deficit in the analysis of our results and link it to the presence of vortices at gap edges
We present six new transits of the exoplanet OGLE-TR-111b observed with the Magellan Telescopes in Chile between April 2008 and March 2009 We combine these new transits with five previously published transit epochs for this planet between 2005 and 2006 to extend the analysis of transit timing variations reported for this system
We derive a new planetary radius value of 1 019 +/- 0 026 R_J which is intermediate to the previously reported radii of 1 067 +/- 0 054 R_J (Winn et al 2007) and 0 922 +/- 0 057 R_J (Diaz et al 2008) We also examine the transit timing variation and duration change claims of Diaz et al
(2008) Our analysis of all eleven transit epochs does not reveal any points with deviations larger than 2 sigma and most points are well within 1 sigma Although the transit duration nominally decreases over the four year span of the data systematic errors in the photometry can account for this result
Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Sato and Asada PASJ 61 L29 (2009)] we consider light curves influenced by the orbital inclination and eccentricity of a companion in orbit around a transiting extrasolar planet (in a planet-satellite system or a hypothetical true binary) We show that the semimajor axis
eccentricity and inclination angle of a `moon&#39; orbit around the host planet can be determined by transit method alone For this purpose we present a formulation for the parameter determinations in a small-eccentricity approximation as well as in the exact form As a result the semimajor axis is expressed in terms of observables such as brightness changes
Saturn is the only known planet to have coorbital satellite systems In the present work we studied the process of mass accretion as a possible mechanism for coorbital satellites formation The system considered is composed of Saturn a proto-satellite and a cloud of planetesimals distributed in the coorbital region around a triangular Lagrangian point
The adopted relative mass for the proto-satellite was 10^-6 of Saturn&#39;s mass and for each planetesimal of the cloud three cases of relative mass were considered 10^-14 10^-13 and 10^-12 masses of Saturn In the simulations each cloud of planetesimal was composed of 10^3 5 x 10^3 or 10^4 planetesimals
The results of the simulations show the formation of coorbital satellites with relative masses of the same order of those found in the saturnian system (10^-13 - 10^-9) Most of them present horseshoe type orbits but a significant part is in tadpole orbit around L_4 or L_5 Therefore the results indicate that this is a plausible mechanism for the formation of coorbital satellites
Surveys for exoplanetary transits are usually limited not by photon noise but rather by the amount of red noise in their data In particular although the CoRoT spacebased survey data are being carefully scrutinized significant new sources of systematic noises are still being discovered Recently a magnitude-dependant systematic effect was discovered in the CoRoT data by Mazeh &amp; Guterman et al
and a phenomenological correction was proposed Here we tie the observed effect a particular type of effect and in the process generalize the popular Sysrem algorithm to include external parameters in a simultaneous solution with the unknown effects We show that a post-processing scheme based on this algorithm performs well and indeed allows for the detection of new transit-like signals that were not previously detected
The difference between the measured atmospheric abundances of neon argon krypton and xenon for Venus the Earth and Mars is striking Because these abundances drop by at least two orders of magnitude as one moves outward from Venus to Mars the study of the origin of this discrepancy is a key issue that must be explained if we are to fully understand the different delivery mechanisms of the volatiles accreted by the terrestrial planets
In this work we aim to investigate whether it is possible to quantitatively explain the variation of the heavy noble gas abundances measured on Venus the Earth and Mars assuming that cometary bombardment was the main delivery mechanism of these noble gases to the terrestrial planets To do so we use recent dynamical simulations that allow the study of the impact fluxes of comets upon the terrestrial planets during the course of their formation and evolution
Assuming that the mass of noble gases delivered by comets is proportional to rate at which they collide with the terrestrial planets we show that the krypton and xenon abundances in Venus and the Earth can be explained in a manner consistent with the hypothesis of cometary bombardment In order to explain the krypton and xenon abundance differences between the Earth and Mars
Outward migration of low-mass planets has recently been shown to be a possibility in non-barotropic disks We examine the consequences of this result in evolutionary models of protoplanetary disks Planet migration occurs towards equilibrium radii with zero torque These radii themselves migrate inwards because of viscous accretion and photoevaporation We show that as the surface density and temperature fall
the planet orbital migration and disk depletion timescales eventually become comparable with the precise timing depending on the mass of the planet When this occurs the planet decouples from the equilibrium radius At this time however the gas surface density is already too low to drive substantial further migration A higher mass planet
of 10 Earth masses can open a gap during the late evolution of the disk and stops migrating Low mass planets with 1 or 0 1 Earth masses released beyond 1 AU in our models avoid migrating into the star Our results provide support for the reduced migration rates adopted in recent planet population synthesis models
We hereby study the stability of a massless probe orbiting around an oblate central body (planet or planetary satellite) perturbed by a third body assumed to lie in the equatorial plane (Sun or Jupiter for example) using an Hamiltonian formalism <br>We are able to determine in the parameters space the location of the frozen orbits
namely orbits whose orbital elements remain constant on average to characterize their stability/unstability and to compute the periods of the equilibria <br>The proposed theory is general enough to be applied to a wide range of probes around planet or natural planetary satellites <br>The BepiColombo mission is used to motivate our analysis and to provide specific numerical data to check our analytical results
We have studied planetary systems which are similar to the Solar System and built up from three inner rocky planets (Venus Earth Mars) and two outer gas giants The stability of the orbits of the inner planets is discussed in the cases of different masses of the gas planets To demonstrate the results stability maps were made and it was found that Jupiter could be four times and Saturn could be three times more massive while the orbits of the inner planets stay stable
Similar calculations were made by changing the mass of the Sun In this case the position of the rocky planets and the extension of the liquid water habitable and the UV habitable zones were studied for different masses of the Sun It was found that the orbits of the planets were stable for values greater than 0
We investigate high-magnification events caused by planets in wide binary stellar systems under the strong finite-source effect where the planet orbits one of the companions From this we find that the pattern of central perturbations in triple lens systems commonly appears as a combination of individual characteristic patterns of planetary and binary lens systems in a certain range where the sizes of the caustics induced by a planet and a binary companion are comparable
and the range changes with the mass ratio of the planet to the planet-hosting star Specially we find that because of this central perturbation pattern the characteristic feature of high-magnification events caused by the triple lens systems appears in the residual from the single-lensing light curve despite the strong finite-source effect
and it is discriminated from those of the planetary and binary lensing events and thus can be used for the identification of the existence of both planet and binary companion This characteristic feature is a simultaneous appearance of two features First double negative-spike and single positive-spike features caused by the binary companion appear together in the residual
where the double negative spike occurs at both moments when the source enters and exits the caustic center and the single positive spike occurs at the moment just before the source enters into or just after the source exits from the caustic center Second the magnification excess before or after the single positive-spike feature is positive due to the planet
Context In the search for extrasolar systems by radial velocity technique a precise wavelength calibration is necessary for high-precision measurements The choice of the calibrator is a particularly important question in the infra-red domain where the precision and exploits still fall behind the achievements of the optical <br>Aims We investigate the long-term stability of atmospheric lines as a precise wavelength reference and analyze their sensitivity to different atmospheric and observing conditions
<br>Methods We use HARPS archive data on three bright stars Tau Ceti Mu Arae and Epsilon Eri spanning 6 years and containing high-cadence measurements over several nights We cross-correlate this data with an O2 mask and evaluate both radial velocity and bisector variations down to a photon noise of 1 m/s
<br>Results We find that the telluric lines in the three data-sets are stable down to 10 m/s (r m s ) over the 6 years We also show that the radial velocity variations can be accounted for by simple atmospheric models yielding a final precision of 1-2 m/s <br>Conclusions The long-term stability of atmospheric lines was measured as being of 10 m/s over six years
in spite of atmospheric phenomena Atmospheric lines can be used as a wavelength reference for short-time-scales programs yielding a precision of 5 m/s &#34;out-of-the box&#34; A higher precision down to 2 m/s can be reached if the atmospheric phenomena are corrected for by the simple atmospheric model described making it a very competitive method even on long time-scales
Several authors have shown that precise measurements of transit time variations of exoplanets can be sensitive to other planetary bodies such as exo-moons In addition the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest to their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory These studies however have not considered the effect of the host star
There is a large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars driven by stellar activity In this paper we investigate and estimate the likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets
We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable In particular the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on timescales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-time travel effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet
In this work we investigate the dynamical stability of pre-formed Neptune Trojans under the gravitational influence of the four giant planets in compact planetary architectures over 10 Myr In our modelling the initial orbital locations of Uranus and Neptune (aN) were varied to produce systems in which those planets moved on non-resonant orbits
or in which they lay in their mutual 1 2 2 3 and 3 4 mean-motion resonances (MMRs) In total 420 simulations were carried out examining 42 different architectures with a total of 840000 particles across all runs In the non-resonant cases the Trojans suffered only moderate levels of dynamical erosion
with the most compact systems (those with aN less than or equal 18 AU) losing around 50% of their Trojans by the end of the integrations In the 2 3 and 3 4 MMR scenarios however dynamical erosion was much higher with depletion rates typically greater than 66% and total depletion in the most compact systems
The 1 2 resonant scenarios featured disruption on levels intermediate between the non-resonant cases and other resonant scenarios with depletion rates of the order of tens of percent Overall the great majority of plausible pre-migration planetary architectures resulted in severe levels of depletion of the Neptunian Trojan clouds In particular
if Uranus and Neptune formed near their mutual 2 3 or 3 4 MMR and at heliocentric distances within 18 AU (as favoured by recent studies) we found that the great majority of pre-formed Trojans would have been lost prior to Neptune&#39;s migration This strengthens the case for the great bulk of the current Neptunian Trojan population having been captured during that migration
The detailed interior structure models of super-Earth planets show that there is degeneracy in the possible bulk compositions of a super-Earth at a given mass and radius determined via radial velocity and transit measurements respectively In addition the upper and lower envelopes in the mass--radius relationship corresponding to pure ice planets and pure iron planets
respectively are not astrophysically well motivated with regard to the physical processes involved in planet formation Here we apply the results of numerical simulations of giant impacts to constrain the lower bound in the mass--radius diagram that could arise from collisional mantle stripping of differentiated rocky/iron planets We provide a very conservative estimate for the minimum radius boundary for the entire mass range of large terrestrial planets
A diversity of resonance configurations may be formed under different migration of two giant planets And the researchers show that the HD 128311 and HD 73526 planetary systems are involved in a 2 1 mean motion resonance but not in apsidal corotation because one of the resonance argument circulates over the dynamical evolution
In this paper we investigate potential mechanisms to form the 2 1 librating-circulating resonance configuration <br>In the late stage of planetary formation scattering or colliding among planetesimals and planetary embryos can frequently occur Hence in our model we consider a planetary configuration of two giants together with few terrestrial planets
We find that both colliding or scattering events at very early stage of dynamical evolution can influence the configurations trapped into resonance A planet-planet scattering of a moderate terrestrial planet or multiple scattering of smaller planets in a crowded planetary system can change the resonant configuration In addition collision or merging can alter the masses and location of the giant planets
% context The precise and accurate modelling of a terrestrial planet like Venus is an exciting and challenging topic all the more interesting since it can be compared with that of the Earth for which such a modelling has already been achieved at the milliarcsecond level % aims We want to complete a previous study (Cottereau and Souchay
by determining at the milliarcsecond level the polhody i e the torque-free motion of the axis of angular momentum of a rigid Venus in a body-fixed frame as well as the nutation of its third axis of figure in space which is fundamental from an observational point of view results
In a first part we have computed the polhody i e the respective free rotational motion of the axis of angular momentum of Venus with respect to a body-fixed frame We have shown that this motion is highly elliptical with a very long period of 525 cy to be compared with 430 d for the Earth
This is due to the very small dynamical flattening of Venus in comparison with our planet In a second part we have computed precisely the Oppolzer terms which allow to represent the motion in space of the third Venus figure axis with respect to Venus angular momentum axis under the influence of the solar gravitational torque
We have determined the corresponding tables of coefficients of nutation of the third figure axis both in longitude and in obliquity due to the Sun which are of the same order of amplitude as for the Earth We have shown that the coefficients of nutation for the third figure axis are significantly different from those of the angular momentum axis on the contrary of the Earth
We present recent observations from the HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aimed at characterizing the auroral emission from the extrasolar planet HD209458b We obtained medium-resolution (R~18-20 000) far-ultraviolet (1150-1700A) spectra at both the Phase 0 25 and Phase 0 75 quadrature positions as well as a stellar baseline measurement at secondary eclipse
This analysis includes a catalog of stellar emission lines and a star-subtracted spectrum of the planet We present an emission model for planetary H2 emission and compare this model to the planetary spectrum No unambiguously identifiable atomic or molecular features are detected and upper limits are presented for auroral/dayglow line strengths
An orbital velocity cross-correlation analysis finds a statistically significant (3 8 sigma) feature at +15 (+/- 20) km/s in the rest frame of the planet at 1582 A This feature is consistent with emission from H2 B-X (2-9) P(4) (lambda_{rest} = 1581 11 A) however the physical mechanism required to excite this transition is unclear
We compare limits on relative line strengths seen in the exoplanet spectrum with models of ultraviolet fluorescence to constrain the atmospheric column density of neutral hydrogen between the star and the planetary surface These results support models of short period extrasolar giant planets with weak magnetic fields and extended atomic atmospheres
Janus and Epimetheus are famously known for their distinctive horseshoe-shaped orbits resulting from a 1 1 orbital resonance Every four years these two satellites swap their orbits by a few tens of kilometers as a result of their close encounter Recently Tiscareno et al (2009) have proposed a model of rotation based on images from the Cassini orbiter
These authors inferred the amplitude of rotational librational motion in longitude at the orbital period by fitting a shape model to the recent Cassini ISS images By a quasiperiodic approximation of the orbital motion we describe how the orbital swap impacts the rotation of the satellites To that purpose we have developed a formalism based on quasi-periodic series with long and short-period librations
In this framework the amplitude of the libration at the orbital period is found proportional to a term accounting for the orbital swap We checked the analytical quasi-periodic development by performing a numerical simulation and find both results in good agreement To complete this study the results regarding the short-period librations are studied with the help of an adiabatic-like approach
Mercury is the target of two space missions MESSENGER (NASA) which orbit insertion is planned for March 2011 and ESA/JAXA BepiColombo that should be launched in 2014 Their instruments will observe the surface of the planet with a high accuracy (about 1 arcsec for BepiColombo) what motivates studying its rotation
Mercury is assumed to be composed of a rigid mantle and an at least partially molten core We here study the influence of the core-mantle interactions on the rotation perturbed by the solar gravitational interaction by modeling the core as an ellipsoidal cavity filled with inviscid fluid of constant uniform density and vorticity
We use both analytical (Lie transforms) and numerical tools to study this rotation with different shapes of the core We express in particular the proper frequencies of the system because they characterize the response of Mercury to the different solicitations due to the orbital motion of Mercury around the Sun
We show that contrary to its size the shape of the core cannot be determined from observations of either longitudinal or polar motions However we highlight the strong influence of a resonance between the proper frequency of the core and the spin of Mercury that raises the velocity field inside the core
Of the four giant planets in the Solar system only Jupiter and Neptune are currently known to possess swarms of Trojan asteroids - small objects that experience a 1 1 mean motion resonance with their host planet In Lykawka et al (2009) we performed extensive dynamical simulations including planetary migration
to investigate the origin of the Neptunian Trojan population Utilising the vast amount of simulation data obtained for that work together with fresh results from new simulations we here investigate the dynamical capture of Trojans by all four giant planets from a primordial trans-Neptunian disk We find the likelihood of a given planetesimal from this region being captured onto an orbit within Jupiter&#39;s Trojan cloud lies between several times 10^-6 and 10^-5
For Saturn the probability is found to be in the range &lt;10^-6 to 10^-5 whilst for Uranus the probabilities range between 10^-5 and 10^-4 Finally Neptune displays the greatest probability of Trojan capture with values ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-3 Our results suggest that all four giant planets are able to capture and retain a significant population of Trojan objects from the disk by the end of planetary migration
As a result of encounters with the giant planets prior to Trojan capture these objects tend to be captured on orbits that are spread over a wide range of orbital eccentricities and inclinations The bulk of captured objects are to some extent dynamically unstable and therefore the populations of these objects tend to decay over the age of the Solar System
providing an important ongoing source of new objects moving on dynamically unstable orbits among the giant planets Given that a huge population of objects would be displaced by Neptune&#39;s outward migration (with a potential cumulative mass a number of times that of the Earth) we conclude that the surviving remnant of the Trojans captured during the migration of the outer planets might be sufficient to explain the currently known Trojan populations in the outer Solar system
The long-term habitability of Earth-like planets requires low orbital eccentricities A secular perturbation from a distant stellar companion is a very important mechanism in exciting planetary eccentricities as many of the extrasolar planetary systems are associated with stellar companions Although the orbital evolution of an Earth-like planet in a stellar binary is well understood
the effect of a binary perturbation to a more realistic system containing additional gas giant planets has been very little studied Here we provide analytic criteria confirmed by a large ensemble of numerical integrations that identify the initial orbital parameters leading to eccentric orbits We show that an extra-solar earth is likely to experience a broad range of orbital evolution dictated by the location of a gas-giant planet
We report on ground-based FTIR observations being performed within the framework of the ESA-NIVR-KNMI project 2907 entitled &#34;OMI validation by ground based remote sensing ozone columns and atmospheric profiles&#34; for the purpose of OMI data validation FTIR observations were performed during the time frames August-October 2005 June-October 2006 and March-October 2007
mostly under cloud free and clear sky conditions and in some days from early morning to sunset covering the full range of solar zenith angles possible Ozone column and ozone profile data were obtained for the year 2005 using spectral modeling of the ozone spectral band profile near 9 6 microns with the MODTRAN3 band model based on the HITRAN-96 molecular absorption database
The total ozone column values retrieved from FTIR observations are biased low with respect to OMI-DOAS data by 8-10 DU on average where they have a relatively small standard error of about 2% FTIR observations for the year 2006 were simulated by MODTRAN4 modeling For the retrieval of ozone column estimates and particularly ozone profiles from our FTIR observations
we used the following data sources to as input files to construct the (a priori) information for the model satellite Aqua-AIRS water vapor and temperature profiles; Aura-MLS stratospheric ozone profiles (version 1 5) TEMIS climatological ozone profiles and the simultaneously performed surface ozone measurements Ozone total columns obtained from our FTIR observations for year 2006 with MODTRAN4 modeling are matching rather well with OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS data where standard errors are 0
Intersection with the debris of a large (50-100 km) short-period comet during the Upper Palaeolithic provides a satisfactory explanation for the catastrophe of celestial origin which has been postulated to have occurred around 12900 BP and which presaged a return to ice age conditions of duration ~1300 years The Taurid Complex appears to be the debris of this erstwhile comet; it includes at least 19 of the brightest near-Earth objects
A wide observational campaign was carried out in 2004-2009 aimed to complete the ground-based investigation of Lutetia prior to the Rosetta fly-by in July 2010 We have obtained BVRI photometric and V-band polarimetric measurements over a wide range of phase angles and visible and infrared spectra in the 0 4-2
We analyzed them together with previously published data to retrieve information on Lutetia&#39;s surface properties Values of lightcurve amplitudes absolute magnitude opposition effect phase coefficient and BVRI colors of Lutetia surface seen at near pole-on aspect have been determined We defined more precisely parameters of polarization phase curve and showed their distinct deviation from any other moderate-albedo asteroid
An indication of possible variations both in polarization and spectral data across the asteroid surface was found To explain features found by different techniques we propose that (i) Lutetia has a non-convex shape probably due to the presence of a large crater and heterogeneous surface properties probably related to surface morphology; (ii) at least part of the surface is covered by a fine-grained regolith with particle size less than 20 microns; (iii) the closest meteorite analogues of Lutetia&#39;s surface composition are particular types of carbonaceous chondrites or Lutetia has specific surface composition not representative among studied meteorites
We present here observations of the transit of WASP-10b on 14 October 2009 UT taken from the University of Arizona&#39;s 1 55 meter Kuiper telescope on Mt Bigelow Conditions were photometric and accuracies of 2 0 mmag RMS were obtained throughout the transit We have found that the ratio of the planet to host star radii is in agreement with the measurements of Christian et al
(2008) instead of the refinements of Johnson et al (2009) suggesting that WASP-10b is indeed inflated beyond what is expected from theoretical modeling We find no evidence for large (&gt; 20 s) transit timing variations in WASP-10b&#39;s orbit from the ephemeris of Christian et al (2008) and Johnson et al
Wasp-10b is a very interesting transiting extrasolar planet Although its transit is very deep about 40 mmag there are very different estimates of its radius in the literature We present new photometric observations of four complete transits of this planet The whole event was detected for each transit and the final light curve consists of more than 1500 individual CCD exposures
We determine the following system parameters planet to star radius ratio R_p/R_star=0 168 +- 0 001 star radius to semimajor axis ratio R_star/a = 0 094 +- 0 001 and inclination i=87 3 +- 0 1 deg Assuming that the semimajor axis is 0 036 9 +- ^{0 0012}_{0 0014} AU (Christian et al
we obtain the following radius of the planet R_p=1 22 +- 0 05 R_J and radius of the star R_star = 0 75 +- 0 03 The errors include the uncertainty in the stellar mass and the semimajor axis of the planet Surprisingly our estimate of the planet radius is significantly higher (by about 12 percent) than the most recent value of Johnson et al
V-type asteroids in the inner Main Belt (a &lt; 2 5 AU) and the HED meteorites are thought to be genetically related to one another as collisional fragments from the surface of the large basaltic asteroid 4 Vesta We investigate this relationship by comparing the near-infrared (0 7-2 5 micron) spectra of 39 V-type asteroids to laboratory spectra of HED meteorites
The central wavelengths and areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron pyroxene-olivine absorption bands that are characteristic of planetary basalts are measured for both the asteroidal and meteoritic data The band centers are shown to be well correlated however the ratio of areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron absorption bands are much larger for the asteroids than for the meteorites
We argue that this offset in band area ratio is consistent with our currently limited understanding of the effects of space weathering however we can not rule out the possibility that this offset is due to compositional differences Several other possible causes of this offset are discussed <br>Amongst these inner Main Belt asteroids we do not find evidence for non-Vestoid mineralogies
Instead these asteroids seem to represent a continuum of compositions consistent with an origin from a single differentiated parent body In addition our analysis shows that V-type asteroids with low inclinations (i &lt; 6 degrees) tend to have band centers slightly shifted towards long wavelengths This may imply that more than one collision on Vesta&#39;s surface was responsible for producing the observed population of inner belt V-type asteroids
We report the discovery of HAT-P-14b a fairly massive transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the moderately bright star GSC 3086-00152 (V = 9 98) with a period of P = 4 627669 +/- 0 000005 days The transit is close to grazing (impact parameter 0 891 +0 007/-0 008) and has a duration of 0
with a reference epoch of mid transit of Tc = 2454875 28938 +/- 0 00047 (BJD) The orbit is slightly eccentric (e = 0 107 +/- 0 013) and the orientation is such that occultations are unlikely to occur The host star is a slightly evolved mid-F dwarf with a mass of 1
a radius of 1 468 +/- 0 054 R(Sun) effective temperature 6600 +/- 90 K and a slightly metal-rich composition corresponding to [Fe/H] = +0 11 +/- 0 08 The planet has a mass of 2 232 +/- 0 059 M(Jup) and a radius of 1 150 +/- 0 052 R(Jup)
implying a mean density of 1 82 +/- 0 24 g/cm3 Its radius is well reproduced by theoretical models for the 1 3 Gyr age of the system if the planet has a heavy-element fraction of about 50 M(Earth) (7% of its total mass) The brightness near-grazing orientation and other properties of HAT-P-14 make it a favorable transiting system to look for changes in the orbital elements or transit timing variations induced by a possible second planet
This paper considers the evidence that debris disks are self-stirred by the formation of Plutos A model for the dust produced during self-stirring is applied to statistics for A stars As there is no significant difference between excesses of A-stars &lt;50Myr old we focus on reproducing the broad trends the &#34;rise and fall&#34; of the fraction of stars with excesses
Using a population model we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with a self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between 15-120AU Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk fraction rather than a monotonic decline Populations of extended disks with fixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics
due mainly to the slow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk This conclusion that debris disks are narrow belts is independent of the significance of 24um trends for young A-stars We show that the statistics can also be reproduced with a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby eccentric planet
Detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterise the stirring mechanism From a more detailed look at beta Pictoris Moving Group and TW Hydrae Association A-stars we find that the disk around beta Pictoris is likely the result of secular stirring by the proposed planet at ~10AU; the structure of the HR 4796A disk also points to sculpting by a planet
The two other stars with disks HR 7012 and eta Tel possess transient hot dust though the outer eta Tel disk is consistent with a self-stirred origin Planet formation provides a natural explanation for the belt-like nature of debris disks with inner regions cleared by planets that may also stir the disk
CONTEXT In July 2010 the ESA spacecraft Rosetta will fly-by the main belt asteroid 21 Lutetia Several observations of this asteroid have been so far performed but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate For long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high IRAS albedo
Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition similar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites while further observations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite chondrite meteorites AIMS In order to give an important contribution in solving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia in November 2008 we performed visible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG
La Palma Spain) METHODS Thirteen visible spectra have been acquired at different rotational phases RESULTS We confirm the presence of a narrow spectral feature at about 0 47-0 48 micron already found by Lazzarin et al (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia We also find a spectral feature at about 0
detected by Lazzarin et al (2004) on one of their Lutetia&#39;s spectra More importantly our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes between 0 6 and 0 75 micron and in particular we found that up to 20% of the Lutetia surface could have flatter spectra CONCLUSIONS We detected a variation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be interpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical composition
Recently Knutson et al (2010) have demonstrated a correlation between the presence of temperature inversions in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters and the chromospheric activity levels of the host stars Here we show that there is also a correlation with greater than 99 5% confidence between the surface gravity of hot Jupiters and the activity levels of the host stars
such that high surface gravity planets tend be found around high activity stars We also find a less significant positive correlation between planet mass and chromospheric activity but no significant correlation is seen between planet radius and chromospheric activity We consider the possibility that this may be due to an observational bias against detecting lower mass planets around higher activity stars
but conclude that this bias is only likely to affect the detection of planets much smaller than those considered here Finally we speculate on physical origins for the correlation including the possibility that the effect of stellar insolation on planetary radii has been significantly underestimated that strong UV flux evaporates planetary atmospheres
Many global circulation models predict supersonic zonal winds and large vertical shears in the atmospheres of short-period jovian exoplanets Using linear analysis and nonlinear local simulations we investigate hydrodynamic dissipation mechanisms to balance the thermal acceleration of these winds The adiabatic Richardson criterion remains a good guide to linear stability
although thermal diffusion allows some modes to violate it at very long wavelengths and very low growth rates Nonlinearly wind speeds saturate at Mach numbers $\approx 2$ and Richardson numbers $\lesssim 1/4$ for a broad range of plausible diffusivities and forcing strengths Turbulence and vertical mixing though accompanied by weak shocks
dominate the dissipation which appears to be the outcome of a recurrent Kelvin-Helmholtz instability An explicit shear viscosity as well as thermal diffusivity is added to ZEUS to capture dissipation outside of shocks The wind speed is not monotonic nor single valued for shear viscosities larger than about $10^{-3}$ of the sound speed times the pressure scale height
Coarsening the numerical resolution can also increase the speed Hence global simulations that are incapable of representing vertical turbulence and shocks either because of reduced physics or because of limited resolution may overestimate wind speeds We recommend that such simulations include artificial dissipation terms to control the Mach and Richardson numbers and to capture mechanical dissipation as heat
Recently several papers have appeared that examine the process of capturing dark-matter particles from the Galactic halo to orbits bound to the Solar System The authors of these papers predict large enhancements to the local dark-matter density via gravitational three-body interactions with planets However these conclusions are wrong; these papers do not include the inverse process to capture
Triton possesses a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen sustained by the sublimation of surface ices The goal is to determine the composition of Triton&#39;s atmosphere and to constrain the nature of surface-atmosphere interactions We perform high-resolution spectroscopic observations in the 2 32-2 37 $\mu$m range using CRIRES at the VLT
From this first spectroscopic detection of Triton&#39;s atmosphere in the infrared we report (i) the first observation of gaseous methane since its discovery in the ultraviolet by Voyager in 1989 and (ii) the first ever detection of gaseous CO in the satellite The CO atmospheric abundance is remarkably similar to its surface abundance
and appears to be controlled by a thin CO-enriched surface veneer resulting from seasonal transport and/or atmospheric escape The CH$_4$ partial pressure is several times larger than inferred from Voyager This confirms that Triton&#39;s atmosphere is seasonally variable and is best interpreted by the warming of CH$_4$-rich icy grains as Triton passed southern summer solstice in 2000
Most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocity measurements either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetary origin of photometric transit signals This has limited our exploration of the parameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type sharp-lined stars Here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to include hot
fast-rotating stars Planet-like transits have previously been reported in the lightcurve obtained by the SuperWASP survey of the A5 star HD15082 (WASP-33; V=8 3 v sin i = 86 km/sec) Here we report further photometry and time-series spectroscopy through three separate transits which we use to confirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1
From the photometry and the properties of the planet signal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit we directly derive the size of the planet the inclination and obliquity of its orbital plane and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of the star This kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planets around a whole new class of young
early-type stars hence under different physical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than in sharp-lined late-type stars The reflex orbital motion of the star caused by the transiting planet is small yielding an upper mass limit of 4 1 Jupiter masses on the planet We also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar mass in the system
which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet In HD 15082 the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radial pulsations clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal This raises the intriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite or amplify the pulsations in such stars
In a set of 16 drop tower experiments the motion of sub-mm to mm-sized particles under microgravity was observed Illumination by a halogen lamp induced acceleration of the particles due to photophoresis Photophoresis on dust-free chondrules on chondrules glass spheres and metal spheres covered with SiC dust and on pure SiC dust aggregates was studied
This is the first time that photophoretic motion of mm-sized particles has been studied experimentally The absolute values for the photophoretic force are consistent with theoretical expectations for spherical particles The strength of the photophoretic force varies for chondrules dust covered particles and pure dust from low to strong respectively
The transition from liquid metal to silicate rock in the cores of the terrestrial planets is likely to be accompanied by a gradient in the composition of the outer core liquid The electrical conductivity of a volatile enriched liquid alloy can be substantially lower than a light-element-depleted fluid found close to the inner core boundary
In this paper we investigate the effect of radially variable electrical conductivity on planetary dynamo action using an electrical conductivity that decreases exponentially as a function of radius We find that numerical solutions with continuous radially outward decreasing electrical conductivity profiles result in strongly modified flow and magnetic field dynamics
compared to solutions with homogeneous electrical conductivity The force balances at the top of the simulated fluid determine the overall character of the flow The relationship between Coriolis and Lorentz forces near the outer boundary controls the flow and magnetic field intensity and morphology of the system Our results imply that a low conductivity layer near the top of Mercury&#39;s liquid outer core is consistent with its weak magnetic field
We observed three transits of the extrasolar planet HD189733b in HI Lyman-alpha and in a few other lines in the ultraviolet with HST/ACS in the search for atmospheric signatures We detect a transit signature in the Lyman-alpha light curve with a transit depth of 5 05 +/- 0 75 %
This depth exceeds the occultation depth produced by the planetary disk alone at the 3 5-sigma level (statistical) Other stellar emission lines are less bright and taken individually they do not show the transit signature while the whole spectra redward of the Lyman-alpha line has enough photons to show a transit signature consistent with the absorption by the planetary disk alone
The transit depth&#39;s upper limits in the emission lines are 11 1% for OI at 1305A and 5 5% for CII at 1335A The presence of an extended exosphere of atomic hydrogen around HD189733b producing 5% absorption of the full unresolved Lyman-alpha line flux shows that the planet is losing gas
The Lyman-alpha light curve is well-fitted by a numerical simulation of escaping hydrogen in which the planetary atoms are pushed by the stellar radiation pressure We constrain the escape rate of atomic hydrogen to be between 10^9 and 10^{11} g/s and the ionizing extreme UV flux between 2 and 40 times the solar value (1-sigma)
The issue of giant planet formation by core instability (CI) far from the central star is rather controversial because the growth of massive solid core necessary for triggering the CI can take longer than the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk In this work we assess the range of separations at which the CI may operate by (1) allowing for arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate of planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the dependence of the critical mass for the CI on the planetesimal accretion luminosity
This self-consistent approach distinguishes our work from similar studies in which only a specific planetesimal accretion regime was explored and/or the critical core mass was fixed at some arbitrary level We demonstrate that the largest separation at which the CI can occur within 3 Myr corresponds to the surface density of solids in the disk higher than 0
This limiting separation is achieved when the planetesimal accretion proceeds at the fastest possible rate even though the high associated accretion luminosity increases the critical core mass delaying the onset of the CI Our constraints are independent of the mass of the central star and vary only weakly with the core density and its atmospheric opacity
Among multi-planet planetary systems there are a large fraction of resonant systems Studying the dynamics and formation of these systems can provide valuable informations on processes taking place in protoplanetary disks where the planets are thought have been formed The recently discovered resonant system HD 60532 is the only confirmed case
in which the central star hosts a pair of giant planets in 3 1 mean motion resonance We intend to provide a physical scenario for the formation of HD 60532 which is consistent with the orbital solutions derived from the radial velocity measurements Observations indicate that the system is in an antisymmetric configuration
while previous theoretical investigations indicate an asymmetric equilibrium state The paper aims at answering this discrepancy as well We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of thin disks with an embedded pair of massive planets Additionally migration and resonant capture are studied by gravitational N-body simulations that apply properly parametrized non-conservative forces
Our simulations suggest that the capture into the 3 1 mean motion resonance takes place only for higher planetary masses thus favouring orbital solutions having relatively smaller inclination i=20 degrees The system formed by numerical simulations qualitatively show the same behaviour as HD 60532 We also find that the presence of an inner disk (between the inner planet and the star) plays a very important role in determining the final configurations of resonant planetary systems
We report precise Doppler measurements of seven subgiants from Keck Observatory All seven stars show variability in their radial velocities consistent with planet-mass companions in Keplerian orbits The host stars have masses ranging from 1 1 &lt; Mstar/Msun &lt; 1 9 radii 3 4 &lt; Rstar/Rsun &lt; 6 1 and metallicities -0
The planets are all more massive than Jupiter (Msini &gt; 1 Mjup) and have semimajor axes &gt; 1 AU We present millimagnitude photometry from the T3 0 4m APT at Fairborn observatory for five of the targets Our monitoring shows these stars to be photometrically stable further strengthening the interpretation of the observed radial velocity variability
The orbital characteristics of the planets thus far discovered around former A-type stars are very different from the properties of planets around dwarf stars of spectral type F G and K and suggests that the formation and migration of planets is a sensitive function of stellar mass Three of the planetary systems show evidence of long-term
We have combined the thermo-chemical disc code ProDiMo with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to calculate a grid of ~300000 circumstellar disc models systematically varying 11 stellar disc and dust parameters including the total disc mass several disc shape parameters and the dust-to-gas ratio For each model dust continuum and line radiative transfer calculations are carried out for 29 far IR
sub-mm and mm lines of [OI] [CII] 12CO and o/p-H2O under 5 inclinations The grid allows to study the influence of the input parameters on the observables to make statistical predictions for different types of circumstellar discs and to find systematic trends and correlations between the parameters the continuum fluxes
and the line fluxes The model grid comprising the calculated disc temperatures and chemical structures the computed SEDs line fluxes and profiles will be used in particular for the data interpretation of the Herschel open time key programme GASPS The calculated line fluxes show a strong dependence on the assumed UV excess of the central star
Scope of this contribution is twofold First it describes the potential of the global astrometry mission Gaia for detecting and measuring planetary systems based on detailed double-blind mode simulations and on the most recent predictions of the satellite&#39;s astrometric payload performances (launch is foreseen for late Summer 2012) Then the identified capabilities are put in context by highlighting the contribution that the Gaia exoplanet discoveries will be able to bring to the science of extrasolar planets of the next decade
We report new radial velocities of the TrES-4 transiting planetary system including observations of a full transit with the High Dispersion Spectrograph of the Subaru 8 2m telescope Modeling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicates that TrES-4b has closely aligned orbital and stellar spin axes with $\lambda = 6 3^{\circ} \pm 4
The close spin-orbit alignment angle of TrES-4b seems to argue against a migration history involving planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles although there are two nearby faint stars that could be binary companion candidates Comparison of our out-of-transit data from 4 different runs suggest that the star exhibits radial velocity variability of $\sim$20 ms^-1 in excess of a single Keplerian orbit
We present high-resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of protostellar discs in a turbulent molecular cloud Using a piecewise polytropic equation of state we perform two sets of simulations In both cases we find that isolated systems undergo a fundamentally different evolution than members of binary or multiple systems
When formed isolated systems must accrete mass and increase their specific angular momentum leading to the formation of massive extended discs which undergo strong gravitational instabilities and are susceptible to disc fragmentation Fragments with initial masses of 5 5 M_jup 7 4 M_jup and 12 M_jup are produced in our simulations
In binaries and small clusters we observe that due to competition for material from the parent core members do not accrete significant amounts of high specific angular momentum gas relative to isolated systems We find that discs in multiple systems are strongly self-gravitating but that they are stable against fragmentation due to disc truncation and mass profile steeping by tides
We observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet WASP-12b using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope The close proximity of WASP-12b to its G-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducing apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades This precession would be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity
leading to an estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central concentration in the planetary interior An initial ground-based secondary eclipse phase reported by Lopez-Morales et al (0 510 +/- 0 002) implied eccentricity at the 4 5 sigma level The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al
has eccentricity 0 049 +/- 0 015 a 3 sigma result implying an eclipse phase of 0 509 +/- 0 007 However there is a well documented tendency of spectroscopic data to overestimate small eccentricities Our eclipse phases are 0 5010 +/- 0 0006 (3 6 and 5 8 microns) and 0
An unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy but the final eclipse phase of Lopez-Morales et al (0 510 -0 006 / +0 007) is consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2 sigma An orbit fit to all the available transit
Extrasolar planets are a natural extension of the interacting binaries towards the companions with very small masses and similar tools might be used to study them Unfortunately the generally accepted treatment of the reflection effect in interacting binaries is not very suitable to study cold objects irradiated by hot objects or extrasolar planets
Our simple model of the reflection effect takes into account the reflection (scattering) heating and heat redistribution over the surface of the irradiated object The shape of the objects is described by the Roche potential and limb and gravity darkening can be taken into account The orbital revolution and rotation of the planet with proper Doppler shifts for the scattered and thermal radiation are also accounted for
Subsequently light-curves and/or spectra of exoplanets were modeled and the effects of the heat redistribution limb darkening/brightening (non-)grey albedo and non-spherical shape were studied Recent observations of HD189733b WASP12b and Wasp-19b were reproduced reasonably well HD189733b has low Bond albedo and intense heat redistribution Wasp-19b has low Bond albedo and low heat redistribution
We also calculate the exact Roche shapes and temperature distribution over the surface of all 78 transiting extrasolar planets known so far It is found that the departures from the sphere vary considerably within the sample Departures of about 1% are common In some cases WASP-12b WASP-19b WASP-33b departures can reach about 14
The transiting exoplanet WASP-18b was discovered in 2008 by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) project The Spitzer Exoplanet Target of Opportunity Program observed secondary eclipses of WASP-18b using Spitzer&#39;s Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) in the 3 6 micron and 5 8 micron bands on 2008 December 20 and in the 4
We report eclipse depths of 0 30 +/- 0 02% 0 39 +/- 0 02% 0 37 +/- 0 03% 0 41 +/- 0 02% and brightness temperatures of 3100 +/- 90 3310 +/- 130 3080 +/- 140 and 3120 +/- 110 K in order of increasing wavelength WASP-18b is one of the hottest planets yet discovered - as hot as an M-class star
Using a 3D GCM we create dynamical model atmospheres of a representative transiting giant exoplanet HD 209458b We post-process these atmospheres with an opacity code to obtain transit radius spectra during the primary transit Using a spectral atmosphere code we integrate over the face of the planet seen by an observer at various orbital phases and calculate light curves as a function of wavelength and for different photometric bands
The products of this study are generic predictions for the phase variations of a zero-eccentricity giant planet&#39;s transit spectrum and of its light curves We find that for these models the temporal variations in all quantities and the ingress/egress contrasts in the transit radii are small ($&lt; 1 0$\%) Moreover
we determine that the day/night contrasts and phase shifts of the brightness peaks relative to the ephemeris are functions of photometric band The $J$ $H$ and $K$ bands are shifted most while the IRAC bands are shifted least Therefore we verify that the magnitude of the downwind shift in the planetary ``hot spot&#34; due to equatorial winds is strongly wavelength-dependent
The phase and wavelength dependence of light curves and the associated day/night contrasts can be used to constrain the circulation regime of irradiated giant planets and to probe different pressure levels of a hot Jupiter atmosphere We posit that though our calculations focus on models of HD 209458b similar calculations for other transiting hot Jupiters in low-eccentricity orbits should yield transit spectra and light curves of a similar character
We present precise Doppler measurements of four stars obtained during the past decade at Keck Observatory by the California Planet Survey (CPS) These stars namely HD 34445 HD 126614 HD 13931 and Gl 179 all show evidence for a single planet in Keplerian motion We also present Doppler measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) for two of the stars
HD 34445 and Gl 179 that confirm the Keck detections and significantly refine the orbital parameters These planets add to the statistical properties of giant planets orbiting near or beyond the ice line and merit follow-up by astrometry imaging and space-borne spectroscopy Their orbital parameters span wide ranges of planetary minimum mass (M sin i = 0
orbital period (P = 2 87-11 5 yr) semi-major axis (a = 2 1-5 2 AU) and eccentricity (e = 0 02-0 41) HD 34445b (P = 2 87 yr M sin i = 0 79 M_Jup e = 0 27) is a massive planet orbiting an old G-type star
We announce a planet HD 126614Ab and an M dwarf HD 126614B orbiting the metal-rich star HD 126614 (which we now refer to as HD 126614A) The planet HD 126614Ab has minimum mass M sin i = 0 38 M_Jup and orbits the stellar primary with period P = 3
The faint M dwarf companion HD 126614B is separated from the stellar primary by 489 mas (33 AU) and was discovered with direct observations using adaptive optics and the PHARO camera at Palomar Observatory The stellar primary in this new system HD 126614 A has the highest measured metallicity (\feh = +0
HD 13931b (P = 11 5 yr M sin i = 1 88 M_Jup e = 0 02) is a Jupiter analog orbiting a near solar twin Gl 179b (P = 6 3 yr M sin i = 0 82 M_Jup e = 0 21) is a massive planet orbiting a faint M dwarf
We report the discovery of HD 156668b an extrasolar planet with a minimum mass of M_P sin i = 4 15 M_Earth This planet was discovered through Keplerian modeling of precise radial velocities from Keck-HIRES and is the second super-Earth to emerge from the NASA-UC Eta-Earth Survey The best-fit orbit is consistent with circular and has a period of P = 4
The Doppler semi-amplitude of this planet K = 1 89 m/s is among the lowest ever detected on par with the detection of GJ 581e using HARPS A longer period (P ~ 2 3 yr) low-amplitude signal of unknown origin was also detected in the radial velocities and was filtered out of the data while fitting the short-period planet
Additional data are required to determine if the long-period signal is due to a second planet stellar activity or another source Photometric observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory show that HD 156668 (an old quiet K3 dwarf) is photometrically constant over the radial velocity period to 0
The variations of gravity were measured with a high precision LaCoste-Romberg D gravimeter during a total solar eclipse to investigate the effect of solar eclipse on the gravitational field The observed anomaly $(7 0 \pm 2 7) \times 10^{-8}$ m/s$^2$ during the eclipse implies that there may be a shielding property of gravitation
In this work we study Herbig-Haro objects located in the region around the head of the cometary globule CG 30 Two sets of optical images are presented The first set was obtained with the 3 5 m New Technology Telescope in 1995 in three emission lines Halpha [SII]6731 6716 A and [OII]3729 A
The second set is an Halpha image of the CG 30/31/38 complex obtained in 2006 with the 8 m Subaru telescope A proper motion study of the HH objects in the region was performed using the Halpha images from both epochs Due to the high resolution of our images we were able to
for the first time resolve the HH 120 object into ten knots and measure proper motions for some of them We discover several new HH objects and a large bipolar jet HH 950 emerging from the head of CG 30 We suggest that two previously known submillimeter sources are the driving sources for the HH 120 and HH 950 flows
The polar condensation/sublimation of CO2 that involve about one fourth of the atmosphere mass is the major Martian climatic cycle Early observations in visible and thermal infrared have shown that the sublimation of the Seasonal South Polar Cap (SSPC) is not symmetric around the geographic South Pole Here we use observations by OMEGA/Mars Express in the near-infrared to detect unambiguously the presence of CO2 at the surface
and to estimate albedo Second we estimate the sublimation of CO2 released in the atmosphere and show that there is a two-step process From Ls=180° to 220° the sublimation is nearly symmetric with a slight advantage for the cryptic region After Ls=220° the anti-cryptic region sublimation is stronger Those two phases are not balanced such that there is 22% +/- 9 more mass the anti-cryptic region
We present near-infrared Ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipse of the hot Jupiter TrES-2b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope We detect its thermal emission with an eclipse depth of 0 062 +/- 0 012% (5-sigma) Our best-fit secondary eclipse is consistent with a circular orbit (a 3-sigma upper limit on the eccentricity
e and argument or periastron omega of |ecos(omega)| &lt; 0 0090) in agreement with mid-infrared detections of the secondary eclipse of this planet A secondary eclipse of this depth corresponds to a day-side Ks-band brightness temperature of TB = 1636 +/- 88 K Our thermal emission measurement when combined with the thermal emission measurements using Spitzer/IRAC from O&#39;Donovan and collaborators suggest that this planet exhibits relatively efficient day to night-side redistribution of heat and a near isothermal dayside atmospheric temperature structure
with a spectrum that is well approximated by a blackbody It is unclear if the atmosphere of TrES-2b requires a temperature inversion; if it does it is likely due to chemical species other than TiO/VO as the atmosphere of TrES-2b is too cool to allow TiO/VO to remain in gaseous form
The goal of the Herschel Open Time Key programme &#34;TNOs are Cool &#34; is to derive the physical and thermal properties for a large sample of Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) including resonant classical detached and scattered disk objects We present results for seven targets either observed in PACS point-source
or in mini scan-map mode Spitzer-MIPS observations were included for three objects The sizes of these targets range from 100 km to almost 1000 km five have low geometric albedos below 10% (145480) 2005 TB190 has a higher albedo above 15% Classical thermal models driven by an intermediate beaming factor of $\eta$=1
More sophisticated thermophysical models give very similar diameter and albedo values for thermal inertias in the range 0-25 Jm-2s-0 5K-1 consistent with very low heat conductivities at temperatures far away from the Sun The early experience with observing and model strategies will allow us to derive physical and thermal properties for our complete Herschel TNO sample of 140 targets as a benchmark for understanding the solar system debris disk
After Earth&#39;s origin our host star the Sun was shining 20 to 25 percent less brightly than today Without greenhouse-like conditions to warm the atmosphere our early planet would have been an ice ball and life may never have evolved But life did evolve which indicates that greenhouse gases must have been present on early Earth to warm the planet
Evidence from the geologic record indicates an abundance of the greenhouse gas CO2 CH4 was probably present as well and in this regard methanogenic bacteria which belong to a diverse group of anaerobic procaryotes that ferment CO 2 plus H2 to CH4 may have contributed to modification of the early atmosphere
Molecular oxygen was not present as is indicated by the study of rocks from that era which contain iron carbonate rather than iron oxide Multicellular organisms originated as cells within colonies that became increasingly specialized The development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun&#39;s energy to be harvested directly by life forms
The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and formed the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere Aided by the absorption of harmful UV radiation in the ozone layer life colonized Earth&#39;s surface Our own planet is a very good example of how life forms modified the atmosphere over the planets&#39; life time
We show that these facts have to be taken into account when we discover and characterize atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets If life has originated and evolved on a planet then it should be expected that a strong co-evolution occurred between life and the atmosphere the result of which is the planets&#39; climate
Here we report WFPC2 observations of the Quaoar-Weywot Kuiper belt binary From these observations we find that Weywot is on an elliptical orbit with eccentricity of 0 14 {\pm} 0 04 period of 12 438 {\pm} 0 005 days and a semi-major axis of 1 45 {\pm} 0 08 {\times} 104 km
The orbit reveals a surpsingly high Quaoar-Weywot system mass of 1 6{\pm}0 3{\times}10^21 kg Using the surface properties of the Uranian and Neptunian satellites as a proxy for Quaoar&#39;s surface we reanalyze the size estimate from Brown and Trujillo (2004) We find from a mean of available published size estimates
Correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet formation process We analyze a sample of 1194 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity
Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0 2 Msun to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1 9 Msun In agreement with previous studies our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \propto 10^{1
We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98% confidence) which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets are not likely due to convective envelope &#34;pollution &#34; Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H]&lt; 0 indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities
We also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass (f \propto Mstar) characterized by a rise from 3 5% around M dwarfs (0 5 Msun) to 14% around A stars (2 Msun) at Solar metallicity We argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretion model of planet formation
Processes such as the solar wind sputtering and micrometeorite impacts can modify optical properties of surfaces of airless bodies This explains why spectra of the main belt asteroids exposed to these `space weathering&#39; processes over eons do not match the laboratory spectra of ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites In contrast an important fraction of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs)
defined as Q-types in the asteroid taxonomy display spectral attributes that are a good match to OCs Here we study the possibility that the Q-type NEAs underwent recent encounters with the terrestrial planets and that the tidal gravity (or other effects) during these encounters exposed fresh OC material on the surface (thus giving it the Q-type spectral properties)
We used numerical integrations to determine the statistics of encounters of NEAs to planets The results were used to calculate the fraction and orbital distribution of Q-type asteroids expected in the model as a function of the space weathering timescale t_sw (see main text for definition) and maximum distance r*
at which planetary encounters can reset the surface We found that t_sw ~ 1e6 yr (at 1 AU) and r* ~ 5 R_pl where R_pl is the planetary radius best fit the data Values t_sw &lt; 1e5 yr would require that r* &gt; 20 R_pl which is probably implausible because these very distant encounters should be irrelevant
Also the fraction of Q-type NEAs would be probably much larger than the one observed if t_sw &gt; 1e7 yr We found that t_sw ~ q^2 where q is the perihelion distance expected if the solar wind sputtering controls t_sw provides a better match to the orbital distribution of Q-type NEAs than models with fixed t_sw
The Galileo probe showed that Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere is severely depleted in neon compared to protosolar values We show via ab initio simulations of the partitioning of neon between hydrogen and helium phases that the observed depletion can be explained by the sequestration of neon into helium-rich droplets within the postulated hydrogen-helium immiscibility layer of the planet&#39;s interior
We have developed a one-dimensional thermochemical kinetics and diffusion model for Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere that accurately describes the transition from the thermochemical regime in the deep troposphere (where chemical equilibrium is established) to the quenched regime in the upper troposphere (where chemical equilibrium is disrupted) The model is used to calculate chemical abundances of tropospheric constituents and to identify important chemical pathways for CO-CH4 interconversion in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres
In particular the observed mole fraction and chemical behavior of CO is used to indirectly constrain the Jovian water inventory Our model can reproduce the observed tropospheric CO abundance provided that the water mole fraction lies in the range (0 25-6 0) x 10^-3 in Jupiter&#39;s deep troposphere corresponding to an enrichment of 0
Our results suggest that Jupiter&#39;s oxygen enrichment is roughly similar to that for carbon nitrogen and other heavy elements and we conclude that formation scenarios that require very large (&gt;8 times solar) enrichments in water can be ruled out We also evaluate and refine the simple time-constant arguments currently used to predict the quenched CO abundance on Jupiter
It was shown in previous works the existence of weakly chaotic orbits in the plutino population that diffuse very slowly These orbits correspond to long-term plutino escapers and then represent the plutinos that are escaping from the resonance at present In this paper we perform numerical simulations in order to explore the dynamical evolution of plutinos recently escaped from the resonance
The numerical simulations were divided in two parts In the first one we evolved 20 000 test particles in the resonance in order to detect and select the long-term escapers In the second one we numerically integrate the selected escaped plutinos in order to study their dynamical post escaped behavior
Our main results include the characterization of the routes of escape of plutinos and their evolution in the Centaur zone We obtained a present rate of escape of plutinos between 1 and 10 every 10 years The escaped plutinos have a mean lifetime in the Centaur zone of 108 Myr and their contribution to the Centaur population would be a fraction of less than 6 % of the total Centaur population
To ascertain whether magnetic dynamos operate in rocky exoplanets more massive or hotter than the Earth we developed a parametric model of a differentiated rocky planet and its thermal evolution Our model reproduces the established properties of Earth&#39;s interior and magnetic field at the present time When applied to Venus
assuming that planet lacks plate tectonics and has a dehydrated mantle with an elevated viscosity the model shows that the dynamo shuts down or never operated Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass dynamo history is sensitive to core size but not to the initial inventory of long-lived
heat-producing radionuclides It predicts that rocky planets larger than 2 5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the temperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the core adiabat Instead iron &#34;snow&#34; will condense near or at the top of these cores and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and a dynamo
More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling but only if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics) The lifetime of these dynamos is shorter with increasing planet mass but longer with higher surface temperature Massive Venus-like planets with stagnant lids and more viscous mantles will lack dynamos altogether
Haumea a rapidly rotating elongated dwarf planet (~ 1500 km in diameter) has two satellites and is associated with a &#34;family&#34; of several smaller Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) in similar orbits All members of the Haumea system share a water ice spectral feature that is distinct from all other KBOs
The relative velocities between the Haumea family members are too small to have formed by catastrophic disruption of a large precursor body which is the process that formed families around much smaller asteroids in the Main Belt Here we show that all of the unusual characteristics of the Haumea system are explained by a novel type of giant collision
a graze-and-merge impact between two comparably sized bodies The grazing encounter imparted the high angular momentum that spun off fragments from the icy crust of the elongated merged body The fragments became satellites and family members Giant collision outcomes are extremely sensitive to the impact parameters Compared to the Main Belt
the largest bodies in the Kuiper Belt are more massive and experience slower velocity collisions; hence outcomes of giant collisions are dramatically different between the inner and outer solar system The dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt record an unexpectedly large number of giant collisions requiring a special dynamical event at the end of solar system formation
A Bayesian analysis of 47 Ursae Majoris (47 UMa) radial velocity data confirms and refines the properties of two previously reported planets with periods of 1079 and 2325 days and finds evidence for an additional long period planet with a period of approximately 10000 days The three planet model is found to be 10^5 times more probable than the next most probable model which is a two planet model
The nonlinear model fitting is accomplished with a new hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which incorporates parallel tempering simulated annealing and genetic crossover operations Each of these features facilitate the detection of a global minimum in chi-squared By combining all three the HMCMC greatly increases the probability of realizing this goal
When applied to the Kepler problem it acts as a powerful multi-planet Kepler periodogram The measured periods are 1078 \pm 2 2391{+100}{-87} and 14002{+4018}{-5095}d and the corresponding eccentricities are 0 032 \pm 0 014 0 098{+ 047}{- 096} and 0 16{+ 09}{- 16} The results favor low eccentricity orbits for all three
Assuming the three signals (each one consistent with a Keplerian orbit) are caused by planets the corresponding limits on planetary mass (M sin i) and semi-major axis are (2 53{+ 07}{- 06}MJ 2 10\pm0 02au) (0 54\pm0 07MJ 3 6\pm0 1au) and (1 6{+0 3}{-0 5}MJ 11 6{+2 1}{-2 9}au)
Knowledge of an exoplanet&#39;s oblateness and obliquity would give clues about its formation and internal structure In principle a light curve of a transiting planet bears information about the planet&#39;s shape but previous work has shown that the oblateness-induced signal will be extremely difficult to detect Here we investigate the potentially larger signals due to planetary spin precession
The most readily detectable effects are transit depth variations (T$\delta$V) in a sequence of light curves For a planet as oblate as Jupiter or Saturn the transit depth will undergo fractional variations of order 1% The most promising systems are those with orbital periods of approximately 15--30 days which is short enough for the precession period to be less than about 40 years
and long enough to avoid spin-down due to tidal friction The detectability of the T$\delta$V signal would be enhanced by moons (which would decrease the precession period) or planetary rings (which would increase the amplitude) The Kepler mission should find several planets for which precession-induced T$\delta$V signals will be detectable
We searched for H2O 6(1 6)-5(2 3) maser emission at 22 235 GHz from several Saturnian satellites with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope in May 2009 Observations were made for Titan Hyperion Enceladus and Atlas for which Pogrebenko et al (2009) had reported detections of water masers at 22 235 GHz
and in addition for Iapetus and other inner satellites We detected no emission of the water maser line for all the satellites observed although sensitivities of our observations were comparable or even better than those of Pogrebenko et al We infer that the water maser emission from the Saturnian system is extremely weak
The criticism contained in the recent preprint <a href="https //arxiv org/abs/1004 5258" data-arxiv-id="1004 5258" class="link-https">arXiv 1004 5258</a> is based essentially on misquoting the articles criticized therein As to the conclusion advocated in that preprint according to which the density of dark matter bound to the Solar System is small as compared to the dark-matter density in the Galactic halo
The disc around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 100546 is one of the most extensively studied discs in the southern sky Although there is a wealth of information about its dust content and composition not much is known about its gas and large scale kinematics We detect and study the molecular gas in the disc at spatial resolution from 7
The lines 12CO J=7-6 J=6-5 J=3-2 13CO J=3-2 and [C I] 3P2-3P1 are observed diagnostic of disc temperature size chemistry and kinematics We use parametric disc models that reproduce the low-J 12CO emission from Herbig~Ae stars and vary the basic disc parameters - temperature mass and size Using the molecular excitation and radiative transfer code RATRAN we fit the observed spectral line profiles
Our observations are consistent with more than 0 001 Msun of molecular gas in a disc of approximately 400 AU radius in Keplerian rotation around a 2 5 Msun star seen at an inclination of 50 degrees The detected 12CO lines are dominated by gas at 30-70~K The non-detection of the [C I] line indicates excess ultraviolet emission above that of a B9 type model stellar atmosphere
Asymmetry in the 12CO line emission suggests that one side of the outer disc is colder by 10-20~K than the other possibly due to a shadow by a warped geometry of the inner disc Pointing offsets foreground cloud absorption and asymmetry in the disc extent are excluded scenarios Efficient heating of the outer disc ensures that low- and high-J 12CO lines are dominated by the outermost disc regions
indicating a 400 AU radius The 12CO J=6--5 line arises from a disc layer higher above disc midplane and warmer by 15-20~K than the layer emitting the J=3--2 line The existing models of discs around Herbig Ae stars assuming a B9 5 type model stellar atmosphere overproduce the [CI] 3P2--3P1 line intensity from HD 100546 by an order of magnitude
Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC 3-8 micron and AKARI IRC 2-4 micron photometry are reported for ten white dwarfs with photospheric heavy elements; nine relatively cool stars with photospheric calcium and one hotter star with a peculiar high carbon abundance A substantial infrared excess is detected at HE 2221-1630 while modest excess emissions are identified at HE 0106-3253 and HE 0307+0746
implying these latter two stars have relatively narrow (Delta r &lt; 0 1 Rsol) rings of circumstellar dust A likely 7 9 micron excess is found at PG 1225-079 and may represent together with G166-58 a sub-class of dust ring with a large inner hole The existence of attenuated disks at white dwarfs substantiates the connection between their photospheric heavy elements and the accretion of disrupted minor planets
Comet C/2006 W3 (Christensen) was observed in November 2009 at 3 3 AU from the Sun with Herschel The PACS instrument acquired images of the dust coma in 70- and 160-micrometers filters and spectra covering several H2O rotational lines Spectra in the range 450-1550 GHz were acquired with SPIRE The comet emission continuum from 70 to 672 micrometers was measured
but no lines were detected The spectral energy distribution indicates thermal emission from large particles and provides a measure of the size distribution index and dust production rate The upper limit to the water production rate is compared to the production rates of other species (CO CH3OH HCN H2S OH) measured with the IRAM 30-m and Nancay telescopes
Recent coronagraphic imaging of the AB Aurigae disk has revealed a region of low polarized scattered light suggestive of perturbations from a planet at a radius of ~100 AU We model this darkened region using our fully non-plane-parallel radiative-transfer code combined with a simple hydrostatic equilibirum approximation to self-consistently solve for the structure of the disk surface as seen in scattered light
We study in detail the motions of three planets interacting with each other under the influence of a central star It is known that the system with more than two planets becomes unstable after remaining quasi-stable for long times leading to highly eccentric orbital motions or ejections of some of the planets
In this paper we are concerned with the underlying physics for this quasi-stability as well as the subsequent instability and advocate the so-called &#34;stagnant motion&#34; in the phase space which has been explored in the field of dynamical system We employ the Lyapunov exponent the power spectra of orbital elements and the distribution of the durations of quasi-stable motions to analyze the phase space structure of the three-planet system
the simplest and hopefully representative one that shows the instability We find from the Lyapunov exponent that the system is almost non-chaotic in the initial quasi-stable state whereas it becomes intermittently chaotic thereafter The non-chaotic motions produce the horizontal dense band in the action-angle plot whereas the voids correspond to the chaotic motions
We obtain power laws for the power spectra of orbital eccentricities Power-law distributions are also found for the durations of quasi-stable states All these results combined together we may reach the following picture the phase space consists of the so-called KAM tori surrounded by satellite tori and imbedded in the chaotic sea
The satellite tori have a self-similar distribution and are responsible for the scale-free power-law distributions of the duration times The system is trapped around one of the KAM torus and the satellites for a long time (the stagnant motion) and moves to another KAM torus with its own satellites from time to time
Efficiency of electron heating through microinstabilities generated in the transition region of a quasi-perpendicular shock for wide ange of Mach numbers is investigated by utilizing PIC (Particle-In-Cell) simulation and model analyses In the model analyses saturation levels of effective electron temperature as a result of microinstabilities are estimated from an extended quasilinear (trapping) analysis for relatively low (high) Mach number shocks
Here MTSI (modified two-stream instability) is assumed to become dominant in low Mach number regime while BI (Buneman instability) to become dominant in high Mach number regime respectively It is revealed that Mach number dependence of the effective electron temperature in the MTSI dominant case is essentially different from that in the BI dominant case
The effective electron temperature through the MTSI does not depend much on the Mach number although that through the BI increases with the Mach number as in the past studies The results are confirmed to be consistent with the PIC simulations both in qualitative and quantitative levels The model analyses predict that a critical Mach number above which steep rise of electron heating rate occurs may arise at the Mach number of a few tens
Hydrodynamical simulations of two giant planets embedded in a gaseous disk have shown that in case of a smooth convergent migration they end up trapped into a mean motion resonance These findings have led to the conviction that the onset of dynamical instability causing close encounters between the planets can occur only after the dissipation of the gas when the eccentricity damping is over
We show that a system of three giant planets may undergo planet-planet scattering when the gaseous disk with density values comparable to that of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula is still interacting with the planets The hydrodynamical code FARGO--2D--1D is used to model the evolution ofthe disk and planets modified to properly handle close encounters between the massive bodies
Our simulations predict a variety of different outcomes of the scattering phase which includes orbital exchange planet merging and scattering of a planet in a hyperbolic orbit This implies thatthe final fate of a multiplanet system under the action of the disk torques is not necessarily a packed resonant configuration
Hot Jupiters with atmospheric temperatures T ~ 1000 K have residual thermal ionization levels sufficient for the interaction of the ions with the planetary magnetic field to result in a sizable magnetic drag on the (neutral) atmospheric winds We evaluate the magnitude of magnetic drag in a representative three-dimensional atmospheric model of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b and find that it is a plausible mechanism to limit wind speeds in this class of atmospheres
Magnetic drag has a strong geometrical dependence both meridionally and from the day to the night side (in the upper atmosphere) which could have interesting consequences for the atmospheric flow pattern By extension close-in eccentric planets with transiently heated atmospheres will experience time-variable levels of magnetic drag A robust treatment of magnetic drag in circulation models for hot atmospheres may require iterated solutions to the magnetic induction and Saha equations as the hydrodynamical flow is evolved
CoRoT-7 b is the first confirmed rocky exoplanet but with an orbital semi-major axis of 0 0172 AU its origins may be unlike any rocky planet in our solar system In this study we consider the roles of tidal evolution and evaporative mass loss in CoRoT-7 b&#39;s history which together have modified the planet&#39;s mass and orbit
If CoRoT-7 b has always been a rocky body evaporation may have driven off almost half its original mass but the mass loss may depend sensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit As tides caused CoRoT-7 b&#39;s orbit to decay they brought the planet closer to its host star
thereby enhancing the mass loss rate Such a large mass loss also suggests the possibility that CoRoT-7 b began as a gas giant planet and had its original atmosphere completely evaporated In this case we find that CoRoT-7 b&#39;s original mass probably didn&#39;t exceed 200 Earth masses (about 2/3 of a Jupiter mass)
Tides raised on the host star by the planet may have significantly reduced the orbital semi-major axis perhaps causing the planet to migrate through mean-motion resonances with the other planet in the system CoRoT-7 c The coupling between tidal evolution and mass loss may be important not only for CoRoT-7 b but also for other close-in exoplanets
EPOXI in October 2007 There have been no direct optical observations of the nucleus of this comet as it has always been highly active when previously observed We aimed to recover the comet near to aphelion to a) confirm that it had not broken up and was in the predicted position
b) to provide astrometry and brightness information for mission planning and c) to continue the characterisation of the nucleus We observed the comet at heliocentric distances between 5 7 and 5 5 AU using FORS2 at the VLT at 4 epochs between May and July 2008 We performed VRI photometry on deep stacked images to look for activity and measure the absolute magnitude and therefore estimate the size of the nucleus
We recovered the comet near the expected position with a magnitude of m_R = 23 74 \pm 0 06 at the first epoch The comet had no visible coma although comparison of the profile with a stellar one showed that there was faint activity or possibly a contribution to the flux from the dust trail from previous activity
This activity appears to fade at further epochs implying that this is a continuation of activity past aphelion from the previous apparition rather than an early start to activity before the next perihelion Our data imply a nucleus radius of \le 1 km for an assumed 4% albedo; we estimate a ~6% albedo
We present direct imaging observations at wavelengths of 3 3 3 8 (L&#39; band) and 4 8 (M band) microns for the planetary system surrounding HR 8799 All three planets are detected at L&#39; The c and d component are detected at 3 3 microns and upper limits are derived from the M band observations
These observations provide useful constraints on warm giant planet atmospheres We discuss the current age constraints on the HR 8799 system and show that several potential co-eval objects can be excluded from being co-moving with the star Comparison of the photometry is made to models for giant planet atmospheres Models which include non-equilibrium chemistry provide a reasonable match to the colors of c and d
The origin of the atmosphere of the largest moon of Saturn Titan is poorly understood and its chemistry is rather complicated Ground-based millimeter/sub-millimeter heterodyne spectroscopy resolves line shapes sufficiently to determine information in Titan&#39;s atmospheric composition (on vertical profiles and isotopic ratios) We test the capabilities of the Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI)
Receiver APEX-1 together with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment APEX 12-m telescope for Titan&#39;s atmospheric observations In particular we present sub-millimeter observations of the CO(2-1) and HCN(3-2) lines of the Titan stratosphere with APEX and with SHFI taken during the Science Verification (SV) instrument phase on March and June 2008 With the help of appropriate radiative transfer calculations we investigate the possibility to constrain the chemical concentrations and optimize the performance of the APEX-1 instrument for inferring vertical profiles of molecular components of the atmosphere of Titan
We examine the scientific viability of an imaging mission to find exo-Earths combining the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with a starshade external occulter under a realistic set of astrophysical assumptions We define an exo-Earth as a planet of 1 to 10 Earth masses orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ) of a solar-type star
We show that for a survey strategy that relies on a single image to detect an exo-Earth roughly half of all exo-Earth detections will be false alarms Here a false alarm is a mistaken identification of a planet as an exo-Earth We consider two survey strategies designed to mitigate the false alarm problem
The first is to require that for each potential exo-Earth a sufficient number of detections are made to measure the orbit When the orbit is known we can determine if the planet is in the habitable zone With this strategy we find that the number of exo-Earths found is on average 0
Here {\eta}_Earth is the frequency of exo-Earths orbiting solar-type stars There is a ~40% probability of finding zero exo-Earths for {\eta}_Earth = 0 1 A second strategy can be employed if a space astrometry mission has identified and measured the orbits and masses of the planets orbiting nearby stars We find that with prior space-based astrometry from a survey of 60 nearby stars
JWST plus an external occulter can obtain orbital solutions for the majority (70% to 80%) of the exo-Earths orbiting these 60 stars The exo-Earth yield is approximately five times higher than the yield for the JWST plus occulter mission without prior astrometry With prior astrometry the probability that an imaging mission will find zero exo-Earths is reduced to below 1% for the case of {\eta}_Earth = 0
Accretion among macroscopic bodies of ~km size or larger is enhanced significantly due to gravitational focusing Two regimes can be distinguished Initially the system experiences runaway growth in which the gravitational focusing factors increase and bodies at the high-mass tail of the distribution grow fastest However at some point the runaway body dynamically heats its environment
gravitational focusing factors decrease and runaway growth passes into oligarchic growth Based on the results of recent simulations we reconsider the runaway growth-oligarchy transition In contrast to oligarchy we find that runaway growth cannot be approximated with a two component model (of small and large bodies) and that the criterion of Ida &amp; Makino (1993)
which is frequently adopted as the start of oligarchy is not a sufficient condition to signify the transition Instead we propose a new criterion based on timescale arguments We then find a larger value for the runaway growth-oligarchy transition from several hundreds of km in the inner disk regions up to ~10^3 km for the outer disk
We investigate the critical core mass and the envelope growth timescale assuming grain-free envelopes to examine how small cores are allowed to form gas giants in the framework of the core accretion model This is motivated by a theoretical dilemma concerning Jupiter formation Modelings of Jupiter&#39;s interior suggest that it contains a small core of &lt; 10 Earth mass
while many core accretion models of Jupiter formation require a large core of &gt; 10 Earth mass to finish its formation by the time of disk dissipation Reduction of opacity in the accreting envelope is known to hasten gas giant formation Almost all the previous studies assumed grain-dominated opacity in the envelope
Instead we examine cases of grain-free envelopes in this study Our numerical simulations show that an isolated core of as small as 1 7 Earth mass is able to capture disk gas to form a gas giant on a timescale of million years if the accreting envelope is grain-free; that value decreases to 0
if the envelope is metal-free namely composed purely of hydrogen and helium It is also shown that alkali atoms which are known to be one of the dominant opacity sources near 1500 K in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters have little contribution to determine the critical core mass Our results confirm that sedimentation and coagulation of grains in the accreting envelope is a key to resolve the dilemma about Jupiter formation
Using data from the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) we investigate the inclination distributions of objects in the Kuiper Belt We present a derivation for observational bias removal and use this procedure to generate unbiased inclination distributions for Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) of different DES dynamical classes with respect to the Kuiper Belt Plane
Consistent with previous results we find that the inclination distribution for all DES KBOs is well fit by the sum of two Gaussians or a Gaussian plus a generalized Lorentzian multiplied by sin i Approximately 80% of KBOs are in the high-inclination grouping We find that Classical object inclinations are well fit by sin i multiplied by the sum of two Gaussians
with roughly even distribution between Gaussians of widths 2 0 -0 5/+0 6 degrees and 8 1 -2 1/+2 6 degrees Objects in different resonances exhibit different inclination distributions The inclinations of Scattered objects are best matched by sin i multiplied by a single Gaussian that is centered at 19
Centaur inclinations peak just below 20 degrees with one exceptionally high-inclination object near 80 degrees The currently observed inclination distribution of the Centaurs is not dissimilar to that of the Scattered Extended KBOs and Jupiter-family comets but is significantly different from the Classical and Resonant KBOs While the sample sizes of some dynamical classes are still small
Context The young active star BD +20 1790 is believed to host a substellar companion revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflex motion induced on the parent star <br>Aims A complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessary in order to assess its nature <br>Methods We used CORALIE spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocity measurements on this active star
while characterizing the bisector span variations Particular attention was given to correctly sample both the proposed planetary orbital period of 7 8 days and the stellar rotation period of 2 4 days <br>Results A smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations &lt;500 m/s) than had been reported previously was detected with different amplitude on two different campaigns
A periodicity similar to the rotational period is found on the data as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities and bisector span This evidence points towards a stellar origin of the radial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of the star and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-Jupiter
We present five band imaging of the Vega debris disc obtained using the Herschel Space Observatory These data span a wavelength range of 70-500 um with full-width half-maximum angular resolutions of 5 6-36 9&#34; The disc is well resolved in all bands with the ring structure visible at 70 and 160 um
Radial profiles of the disc surface brightness are produced and a disc radius of 11&#34; (~ 85 AU) is determined The disc is seen to have a smooth structure thoughout the entire wavelength range suggesting that the disc is in a steady state rather than being an ephemeral structure caused by the recent collision of two large planetesimals

The continuation of resonant periodic orbits from the restricted to the general three body problem is studied in a systematic way Starting from the Keplerian unperturbed system we obtain the resonant families of the circular restricted problem Then we find all the families of the resonant elliptic restricted three body problem which bifurcate from the circular model
All these families are continued to the general three body problem and in this way we can obtain a global picture of all the families of periodic orbits of a two-planet resonant system We consider planar motion only We show that the continuation follows a scheme proposed by Bozis and Hadjidemetriou (1976) for symmetric orbits
Our study includes also asymmetric periodic orbits which exist in cases of external resonances The families formed by passing from the restricted to the general problem are continued within the framework of the general problem by varying the planetary mass ratio $\rho$ We obtain bifurcations which are caused either due to collisions of the families in the space of initial conditions or due to the vanishing of bifurcation points
Our study refers to the whole range of planetary mass ratio values ($\rho \in (0 \infty)$) and therefore we include the passage from external to internal resonances In the present work our numerical study includes the case of the 2/1 and 1/2 resonance The same method can be used to study all other planetary resonances
Based on a pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram model of the Earth Jones &amp; Lineweaver (2010) described uninhabited terrestrial liquid water Our model represents the atmosphere surface oceans and interior of the Earth - allowing the range of P-T conditions in terrestrial environments to be compared to the phase regime of liquid water
Here we present an overview and additional results from the Earth model on the location of the deepest liquid water on Earth and the maximum possible extent of the terrestrial biosphere The intersection of liquid water and terrestrial phase space indicates that the deepest liquid water environments in the lithosphere occur at a depth of ~ 75 km
Considering the 3 5 % of the volume of the Earth where liquid water exists ~ 12% of this volume is inhabited by life while the remaining ~ 88% is uninhabited This is distinct from the fraction of the volume of liquid water occupied by life We find that at least 1% of the volume of liquid water on Earth is uninhabited
We investigate how ideas from the International Environmental Agreement (IEA) literature can be applied to the problem of space debris mitigation The problem of space debris is similar to other international environmental problems in that there is a potential for a tragedy of the commons effect--individual nations bear all the cost of their mitigation measures but share only a fraction of the benefit
Consequently nations have a tendency to underinvest in mitigation Coalitions of nations brought together by IEAs have the potential to lessen the tragedy of the commons effect by pooling the costs and benefits of mitigation This work brings together two recent modeling advances i) a game theoretic model for studying the potential gains from IEA cooperation between nations with asymmetric costs and benefits
ii) an orbital debris model that gives the societal cost that specific actions such as failing to deorbit an inactive satellite have on the environment We combine these two models with empirical launch share data for a &#34;proof of concept&#34; of an IEA for a single mitigation measure deorbiting spacecraft at the end of operational lifetime
Keck near-infrared images of Neptune from UT 26 July 2007 show that the cloud feature typically observed within a few degrees of Neptune&#39;s south pole had split into a pair of bright spots A careful determination of disk center places the cloud centers at -89 07 +/- 0 06 and -87
If modeled as optically thick perfectly reflecting layers we find the pair of features to be constrained to the troposphere at pressures greater than 0 4 bar By UT 28 July 2007 images with comparable resolution reveal only a single feature near the south pole The changing morphology of these circumpolar clouds suggests they may form in a region of strong convection surrounding a Neptunian south polar vortex
The holy grail of exoplanet searches is an exo-Earth an Earth mass planet in the habitable zone around a nearby star Mass is the most important parameter of a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around the planet-star center of mass A single image of a planet
however does not provide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable zone orbit The planet&#39;s orbit however can be measured either by imaging the planet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple epochs by space-based astrometry The measurement of an exo-planet&#39;s orbit by direct imaging is complicated by a number of factors
The paper deals with several properties of the Oort cloud of comets Sun Galaxy (and Jupiter) gravitationally act on the comets New physical model of galactic tide is considered The main results can be summarized as follows <br>1 Mass of the Oort cloud of comets is less than 1 mass of the Earth ($M_{E}$)
probably not greater than 1/2 $M_{E}$ <br>2 Theoretical number of long-period comets with perihelion distance $q$ $&lt;$ 5 AU is about 50-times greater than the conventional approach yields Gravity of Jupiter was taken into account in finding this result <br>3 Semi-major axis $a$ and period of oscillations $P$ of eccentricity (and other orbital elements) are related as $a^{3}$ $P$ $=$ 1 in natural units for a moving Solar System in the Galaxy
The natural unit for time is the orbital period of the Solar System revolution around the galactic center and the natural unit for measuring the semi-major axis is its maximum value for the half-radius of the Solar System corresponding to the half-radius of the Oort cloud The relation holds for the cases when comets approach the inner part of the Solar System
e g perihelion distances are less than $\approx$ 100 AU <br>4 The minimum value of semi-major axis for the Oort cloud is $a_{min}$ $\ll$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{4}$ AU This condition was obtained both from the numerical results on cometary evolution under the action of the galactic tides and from the observational distribution of long-period comets
If the density function of semi-major axis is approximated by proportionality $a^{\alpha}$ then $\alpha$ is - 1/2 approximately <br>5 The magnitude of the change in perihelion distance per orbit $\Delta q$ of a comet due to galactic tides is a strong function of semi-major axis $a$ proportional to $a^{8 25}$
We propose a mechanism for the oxidation of gaseous CO into CO2 occurring on the surface mineral hematite (Fe2O3(s)) in hot CO2-rich planetary atmospheres such as Venus This mechanism is likely to constitute an important source of tropospheric CO2 on Venus and could at least partly address the CO2 stability problem in Venus&#39; stratosphere
since our results suggest that atmospheric CO2 is produced from CO oxidation via surface hematite at a rate of 0 4 Petagrammes (Pg) CO2 per (Earth) year on Venus which is about 45% of the mass loss of CO2 via photolysis in the Venusian stratosphere We also investigated CO oxidation via the hematite mechanism for a range of planetary scenarios and found that modern Earth and Mars are probably too cold for the mechanism to be important because the rate-limiting step
involving CO(g) reacting onto the hematite surface proceeds much slower at lower temperatures The mechanism may feature on extrasolar planets such as Gliese 581c or CoRoT-7b assuming they can maintain solid surface hematite which e g starts to melt above about 1200K The mechanism may also be important for hot Hadean-type environments and for the emerging class of hot Super-Earths with planetary surface temperatures between about 600-900K
We investigate the coupling between rock-size solids and gas during the formation of gas giant planets by disk fragmentation in the outer regions of massive disks In this study we use three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations and model solids as a spatial distribution of particles We assume that half of the total solid fraction is in small grains and half in large solids
The former are perfectly entrained with the gas and set the opacity in the disk while the latter are allowed to respond to gas drag forces with the back reaction on the gas taken into account To explore the maximum effects of gas-solid interactions we first consider 10cm-size particles We then compare these results to a simulation with 1 km-size particles
which explores the low-drag regime We show that (1) disk instability planets have the potential to form large cores due to aerodynamic capturing of rock-size solids in spiral arms before fragmentation; (2) that temporary clumps can concentrate tens of $M_{\oplus}$ of solids in very localized regions before clump disruption; (3) that the formation of permanent clumps
even in the outer disk is dependent on the grain-size distribution i e the opacity; (4) that nonaxisymmetric structure in the disk can create disk regions that have a solids-to-gas ratio greater than unity; (5) that the solid distribution may affect the fragmentation process; (6) that proto-gas giants and proto-brown dwarfs can start as differentiated objects prior to the H$_2$ collapse phase; (7) that spiral arms in a gravitationally unstable disk are able to stop the inward drift of rock-size solids
Aims Disk-averaged infrared spectra of Neptune between 1 8 and 13 $\mu$m obtained by the AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC) in May 2007 have been analysed to (a) determine the globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure; (b) derive the abundances of stratospheric hydrocarbons; and (c) detect fluorescent emission from CO at 4 7 $\mu$m
Methods Mid-infrared spectra were modelled using a line-by-line radiative transfer code to determine the temperature structure between 1-1000 $\mu$bar and the abundances of CH$_4$ CH$_3$D and higher-order hydrocarbons A full non-LTE radiative model was then used to determine the best fitting CO profile to reproduce the fluorescent emission observed at 4
Results The globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure is quasi-isothermal between 1-1000 $\mu$bar which suggests little variation in global stratospheric conditions since studies by the Infrared Space Observatory a decade earlier The derived CH$_4$ mole fraction of $(9 0\pm3 0)\times10^{-4}$ at 50 mbar decreasing to $(0 9\pm0 3)\times10^{-4}$ at 1 $\mu$bar is larger than that expected if the tropopause at 56 K acts as an efficient cold trap
but consistent with the hypothesis that CH$_4$ leaking through the warm south polar tropopause (62-66 K) is globally redistributed by stratospheric motion The ratio of D/H in CH$_4$ of $3 0\pm1 0\times10^{-4}$ supports the conclusion that Neptune is enriched in deuterium relative to the other giant planets We determine a mole fraction of ethane of $(8
We study the effects of gravity waves or g-modes on hot extrasolar planets These planets are expected to possess stably-stratified atmospheres which support gravity waves In this paper we review the derivation of the equation that governs the linear dynamics of gravity waves and describe its application to a hot extrasolar planet
using HD209458 b as a generic example We find that gravity waves can exhibit a wide range of behaviors even for a single atmospheric profile The waves can significantly accelerate or decelerate the background mean flow depending on the difference between the wave phase and mean flow speeds In addition
the waves can provide significant heating (~100 to ~1000 K per planetary rotation) especially to the region of the atmosphere above about 10 scale heights from the excitation region Furthermore by propagating horizontally gravity waves provide a mechanism for transporting momentum and heat from the dayside of a tidally locked planet to its nightside
The final stage of terrestrial planet formation is known as the giant impact stage where protoplanets collide with one another to form planets So far this stage has been mainly investigated by N-body simulations with an assumption of perfect accretion in which all collisions lead to accretion However this assumption breaks for collisions with high velocity and/or a large impact parameter
We derive an accretion condition for protoplanet collisions in terms of impact velocity and angle and masses of colliding bodies from the results of numerical collision experiments For the first time we adopt this realistic accretion condition in N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation from protoplanets We compare the results with those with perfect accretion and show how the accretion condition affects terrestrial planet formation
We find that in the realistic accretion model about half of collisions do not lead to accretion However the final number mass orbital elements and even growth timescale of planets are barely affected by the accretion condition For the standard protoplanetary disk model typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region over about 100 M years in both realistic and perfect accretion models
We also find that for the realistic accretion model the spin angular velocity is about 30% smaller than that for the perfect accretion model that is as large as the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability The spin angular velocity and obliquity obey Gaussian and isotropic distributions respectively independently of the accretion condition
Direct-imaging searches for planets reveal wide orbit planets amenable to spectroscopy and their atmospheres represent an important comparison to the irradiated atmospheres of Hot Jupiters Using AO integral field spectroscopy of 2M1207 b the shape of the continuum emission over the J H and K bands from the atmosphere of this young
planetary mass companion is measured in order to compare with atmospheric and evolutionary models and objects of similar temperature in young clusters and the field The 2M1207 b spectrum has the highest spectral resolution (R~300-1500) and largest wavelength coverage including the first J-band spectrum for this benchmark object The high signal-to-noise of the data allow a clear identification of signatures of low surface gravity
and comparison with a grid of AMES-Dusty models reveals a best-fit effective temperature of Teff=1600 K with a preferred surface gravity of log g=4 5 The J-band flux is depressed relative to nearly all L-type objects and the detailed shape of the absorption features across the H-band exhibit differences from the model predictions
The possible origins of 2M1207 b and its low luminosity are examined with the new data and analysis which suggest that extinction from a disk with large grains is a viable scenario and is preferred over scatttering off an optically thick disk The 2M1207 b spectrum presents an important comparison for the types of features which may be present in upcoming spectra of the atmospheres of planets imaged in orbit around stellar primaries
High-resolution far-infrared and sub-millimetre spectroscopy of water lines is an important tool to understand the physical and chemical properties of cometary atmospheres We present observations of several rotational ortho- and para-water transitions in comet C/2008 Q3 (Garradd) performed with HIFI on Herschel These observations have provided the first detection of the 2_{12}-1_{01} (1669 GHz) ortho and 1_{11}-0_{00} (1113 GHz) para transitions of water in a cometary spectrum
In addition the ground-state transition 1_{10}-1_{01} at 557 GHz is detected and mapped By detecting several water lines quasi-simultaneously and mapping their emission we can constrain the excitation parameters in the coma Synthetic line profiles are computed using excitation models which include excitation by collisions solar infrared radiation and radiation trapping
In order to detect and characterise cold extended circumstellar dust originating from collisions of planetesimal bodies in disks belts or rings at Kuiper-Belt distances (30-50 AU or beyond) sensitive submillimetre observations are essential Measurements of the flux densities at these wavelengths will extend existing IR photometry and permit more detailed modelling of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the disks spectral energy distribution (SED)
effectively constraining dust properties and disk extensions By observing stars spanning from a few up to several hundred Myr the evolution of debris disks during crucial phases of planet formation can be studied We have performed 870-micron observations of 22 exo-Kuiper-Belt candidates as part of a Large Programme with the LABOCA bolometer at the APEX telescope
Dust masses (or upper limits) were calculated from integrated 870-micron fluxes and fits to the SED of detected sources revealed the fractional dust luminosities f_dust dust temperatures T_dust and power-law exponents beta of the opacity law A total of 10 detections with at least 3-sigma significance were made out of which five (HD 95086
HD 131835 HD 161868 HD 170773 and HD 207129) have previously never been detected at submillimetre wavelengths Three additional sources are marginally detected with &gt;2 5-sigma significance The best-fit beta parameters all lie between 0 1 and 0 8 in agreement with previous results indicating the presence of grains that are significantly larger than those in the ISM
On 1998 November 14 Saturn and its rings occulted the star GSC 0622-00345 We observed atmospheric immersion with NSFCAM at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#39;s Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea Hawaii Immersion occurred at 55 5\circ S planetocentric latitude A 2 3 {\mu}m methane-band filter suppressed reflected sunlight
Atmospheric emersion and ring data were not successfully obtained We describe our observation light-curve production and timing techniques including improvements in aperture positioning removal of telluric scintillation effects and timing Many of these techniques are known within the occultation community but have not been described in the reviewed literature We present a light curve whose signal-to-noise ratio per scale height is 267
On 2009 July 19 we observed a single large impact on Jupiter at a planetocentric latitude of 55^{\circ}S This and the Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) impacts on Jupiter in 1994 are the only planetary-scale impacts ever observed The 2009 impact had an entry trajectory opposite and with a lower incidence angle than that of SL9
Comparison of the initial aerosol cloud debris properties spanning 4 800 km east-west and 2 500 km north-south with those produced by the SL9 fragments and dynamical calculations of pre-impact orbit indicate that the impactor was most probably an icy body with a size of 0 5-1 km The collision rate of events of this magnitude may be five to ten times more frequent than previously thought
Numerical simulations of the 3D MHD-equations that describe rotating magnetoconvection in a Cartesian box have been performed using the code NIRVANA The characteristics of averaged quantities like the turbulence intensity and the turbulent heat flux that are caused by the combined action of the small-scale fluctuations are computed The correlation length of the turbulence significantly depends on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field and the anisotropic behavior of the turbulence intensity induced by Coriolis and Lorentz force is considerably more pronounced for faster rotation
The development of isotropic behavior on the small scales -- as it is observed in pure rotating convection -- vanishes even for a weak magnetic field which results in a turbulent flow that is dominated by the vertical component In the presence of a horizontal magnetic field the vertical turbulent heat flux slightly increases with increasing field strength
so that cooling of the rotating system is facilitated Horizontal transport of heat is always directed westwards and towards the poles The latter might be a source of a large-scale meridional flow whereas the first would be important in global simulations in case of non-axisymmetric boundary conditions for the heat flux
We report the detections of two substellar companions orbiting around evolved intermediate-mass stars from precise Doppler measurements at Subaru Telescope and Okayama Astrophysical Observatory HD 145457 is a K0 giant with a mass of 1 9 M_sun and has a planet of minimum mass m_2sini=2 9 M_J orbiting with period of P=176 d and eccentricity of e=0
HD 180314 is also a K0 giant with 2 6 M_sun and hosts a substellar companion of m_2sin i=22 M_J which falls in brown-dwarf mass regime in an orbit with P=396 d and e=0 26 HD 145457 b is one of the innermost planets and HD 180314 b is the seventh candidate of brown-dwarf-mass companion found around intermediate-mass evolved stars
In this work we investigate the accuracy of various approximate expressions for the transit duration of a detached binary against the exact solution found through solving a quartic equation Additionally a new concise approximation is derived which offers more accurate results than those currently in the literature Numerical simulations are performed to test the accuracy of the various expressions
We find that our proposed expression show yields a &gt;200% improvement in accuracy relative to the most previously employed expression We derive a new set of equations for retrieving the lightcurve parameters and consider the effect of falsely using circular expressions for eccentric orbits with particularly important consequences for transit surveys
The new expression also allows us to propose a new lightcurve fitting parameter set which minimizes the mutual correlations and thus improves computational efficiency The equation is also readily differentiated to provide analytic expressions for the transit duration variation (TDV) due to secular variations in the system parameters for example due to apsidal precession induced by perturbing planets
On 1998 November 14 Saturn and its rings occulted the star GSC 0622-00345 The occultation latitude was 55 5 degrees S This paper analyzes the 2 3 {\mu}m light curve derived by Harrington &amp; French A fixed-baseline isothermal fit to the light curve has a temperature of 140 +/- 3 K
assuming a mean molecular mass of 2 35 AMU The thermal profile obtained by numerical inversion is valid between 1 and 60 {\mu}bar The vertical temperature gradient is &gt;0 2 K/km more stable than the adiabatic lapse rate but it still shows the alternating-rounded-spiked features seen in many temperature gradient profiles from other atmospheric occultations and usually attributed to breaking gravity (buoyancy) waves
We conduct a wavelet analysis of the thermal profile and show that even with our low level of noise scintillation due to turbulence in Earth&#39;s atmosphere can produce large temperature swings in light-curve inversions Spurious periodic features in the &#34;reliable&#34; region of a wavelet amplitude spectrum can exceed 0 3 K in our data
We also show that gravity-wave model fits to noisy isothermal light curves can lead to convincing wave &#34;detections&#34; We provide new significance tests for localized wavelet amplitudes wave model fits and global power spectra of inverted occultation light curves by assessing the effects of pre- and post-occultation noise on these parameters
Based on these tests we detect several significant ridges and isolated peaks in wavelet amplitude to which we fit a gravity wave model We also strongly detect the global power spectrum of thermal fluctuations in Saturn&#39;s atmosphere which resembles the &#34;universal&#34; (modified Desaubies) curve associated with saturated spectra of propagating gravity waves on Earth and Jupiter
Aims We aim to demonstrate that the Herschel ATLAS (H-ATLAS) is suitable for a blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debris disks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstration field of the survey We show that H-ATLAS reveals a population of far-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objects on the SDSS main-sequence locus
We validate our approach by comparing the properties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population Methods We use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequence stars in the SDSS DR7 catalogue and a Bayesian Likelihood Ratio method to identify H-ATLAS catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars
Following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify the most likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminating galaxies using UKIDSS LAS K-band images Results We identify 78 H-ATLAS sources associated with SDSS point sources on the main-sequence locus of which two are the most likely debris disk candidates
H-ATLAS J090315 8 and H-ATLAS J090240 2 We show that they are plausible candidates by comparing their properties to the known population of debris disks Our initial results indicate that bright debris disks are rare with only 2 candidates identified in a search sample of 851 stars We also show that H-ATLAS can derive useful upper limits for debris disks associated with Hipparcos stars in the field and outline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme
In addition to the Sun six other stars are known to harbor multiple planets and debris disks HD 69830 HD 38529 HD 128311 HD 202206 HD 82943 and HR 8799 In this paper we set constraints on the location of the dust-producing planetesimals around the latter four systems We use a radiative transfer model to analyze the spectral energy distributions of the dust disks (including two new Spitzer IRS spectra presented in this paper)
The cratering history of main belt asteroid (2867) Steins has been investigated using OSIRIS imagery acquired during the Rosetta flyby that took place on the 5th of September 2008 For this purpose we applied current models describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids that provide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors
These models coupled with appropriate crater scaling laws allow the cratering history to be estimated Hence we derive Steins&#39; cratering retention age namely the time lapsed since its formation or global surface reset We also investigate the influence of various factors -like bulk structure and crater erasing- on the estimated age
which spans from a few hundred Myrs to more than 1Gyr depending on the adopted scaling law and asteroid physical parameters Moreover a marked lack of craters smaller than about 0 6km has been found and interpreted as a result of a peculiar evolution of Steins cratering record possibly related either to the formation of the 2
We have carried out an L&#39; and M band Adaptive Optics (AO) extrasolar planet imaging survey of 54 nearby sunlike stars using the Clio camera at the MMT Our survey concentrates more strongly than all others to date on very nearby F G and K stars in that we have prioritized proximity higher than youth
Our survey is also the first to include extensive observations in the M band which supplemented the primary L&#39; observations These longer wavelength bands are most useful for very nearby systems in which low temperature planets with red IR colors (i e H - L&#39; H - M) could be detected
The survey detected no planets but set interesting limits on planets and brown dwarfs in the star systems we investigated We have interpreted our null result by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations and constrained the distributions of extrasolar planets in mass $M$ and semimajor axis $a$ If planets are distributed according to a power law with $dN \propto M^{\alpha} a^{\beta} dM da$
normalized to be consistent with radial velocity statistics we find that a distribution with $\alpha = -1 1$ and $\beta = -0 46$ truncated at 110 AU is ruled out at the 90% confidence level These particular values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are significant because they represent the most planet-rich case consistent with current statistics from radial velocity observations
With 90% confidence no more than 8 1% of stars like those in our survey have systems with three widely spaced massive planets like the A-star HR 8799 Our observations show that giant planets in long-period orbits around sun-like stars are rare confirming the results of shorter-wavelength surveys and increasing the robustness of the conclusion
We present wide-field imaging of the 2007 outburst of Comet 17P/Holmes obtained serendipitously by SuperWASP-North on 17 nights over a 42-night period beginning on the night (2007 October 22-23) immediately prior to the outburst Photometry of 17P&#39;s unresolved coma in SuperWASP data taken on the first night of the outburst is consistent with exponential brightening
suggesting that the rapid increase in the scattering cross-section of the coma could be largely due to the progressive fragmentation of ejected material produced on a very short timescale at the time of the initial outburst with fragmentation timescales decreasing from t(frag)~2x10^3 s to t(frag)~1x10^3 s over our observing period
Analysis of the expansion of 17P&#39;s coma reveals a velocity gradient suggesting that the outer coma was dominated by material ejected in an instantaneous explosive manner We find an expansion velocity at the edge of the dust coma of v(exp) = 0 55+/-0 02 km/s and a likely outburst date of t_0=2007 October 23
consistent with our finding that the comet remained below SuperWASP&#39;s detection limit of m(V)~15 mag until at least 2007 October 23 3 Modelling of 17P&#39;s gas coma indicates that its outer edge which was observed to extend past the outer dust coma is best explained with a single pulse of gas production
We present results from a wide-field imaging campaign at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to study the spectacular outburst of comet 17P/Holmes in late 2007 Using image-processing techniques we probe inside the spherical dust coma and find sixteen fragments having both spatial distribution and kinematics consistent with isotropic ejection from the nucleus
Photometry of the fragments is inconsistent with scattering from monolithic inert bodies Instead each detected fragment appears to be an active cometesimal producing its own dust coma By scaling from the coma of the primary nucleus of 17P/Holmes assumed to be 1 7 km in radius we infer that the sixteen fragments have maximum effective radii between ~ 10 m and ~ 100 m on UT 2007 Nov
The fragments subsequently fade at a common rate of ~ 0 2 mag/day consistent with steady depletion of ices from these bodies in the heat of the Sun Our characterization of the fragments supports the hypothesis that a large piece of material broke away from the nucleus and crumbled expelling smaller
We present new radial-velocity measurements of HAT-P-13 a star with two previously known companions a transiting giant planet &#34;b&#34; with an orbital period of 3 days and a more massive object &#34;c&#34; on a 1 2 yr highly eccentric orbit For this system dynamical considerations would lead to constraints on planet b&#39;s interior structure
if it could be shown that the orbits are coplanar and apsidally locked By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect we show that planet b&#39;s orbital angular momentum vector and the stellar spin vector are well-aligned on the sky (lambda = -0 9 +/- 8 5 deg) suggesting that the planetary orbits are also well-aligned
The refined orbital solution favors a slightly eccentric orbit for planet b (e = 0 0142_{-0 0044}^{+0 0052}) although it is not clear whether it is apsidally locked with c&#39;s orbit (\Delta\omega = 48_{-38}^{+25} deg) We find a long-term trend in the star&#39;s radial velocity and interpret it as evidence for an additional body &#34;d&#34;
The Jovian regular satellite system mainly consists of four Galilean satellites that have similar masses and are trapped in mutual mean motion resonances except for the outer satellite Callisto On the other hand the Saturnian regular satellite system has only one big icy body Titan and a population of much smaller icy moons
We have investigated the origin of these major differences between the Jovian and Saturnian satellite systems by semi-analytically simulating the growth and orbital migration of proto-satellites in an accreting proto-satellite disk We set up two different disk evolution/structure models that correspond to Jovian and Saturnian systems by building upon previously developed models of an actively-supplied proto-satellite disk
the formation of gas giants and observations of young stars Our simulations extend previous models by including the (1) different termination timescales of gas infall onto the proto-satellite disk and (2) different evolution of a cavity in the disk between the Jovian and Saturnian systems We have performed Monte Carlo simulations and show that in the case of the Jovian systems
four to five similar-mass satellites are likely to remain trapped in mean motion resonances This orbital configuration is formed by type I migration temporal stopping of the migration near the disk inner edge and quick truncation of gas infall caused by Jupiter opening a gap in the Solar nebula The Saturnian systems tend to end up with one dominant body in the outer regions caused by the slower decay of gas infall associated with global depletion of the Solar nebula
We present the observational results of an L&#39; and M band Adaptive Optics (AO) imaging survey of 54 nearby sunlike stars for extrasolar planets carried out using the Clio camera on the MMT We have concentrated more strongly than all other planet imaging surveys to date on very nearby F
G and K stars prioritizing stellar proximity higher than youth Ours is also the first survey to include extensive observations in the M band which supplement the primary L&#39; observations Models predict much better planet/star flux ratios at the L&#39; and M bands than at more commonly used shorter wavelengths (i
e the H band) We have carried out extensive blind simulations with fake planets inserted into the raw data to verify our sensitivity and to establish a definitive relationship between source significance in $\sigma$ and survey completeness We find 97% confident-detection completeness for 10$\sigma$ sources but only 46% for 7$\sigma$ sources -- raising concerns about the standard procedure of assuming high completeness at 5$\sigma$
and demonstrating that blind sensitivity tests to establish the significance-completeness relation are an important analysis step for all planet-imaging surveys We discovered a previously unknown approximately 0 15 solar-mass stellar companion to the F9 star GJ 3876 at a projected separation of about 80 AU Twelve additional candidate faint companions are detected around other stars
Of these eleven are confirmed to be background stars and one is a previously known brown dwarf We obtained sensitivity to planetary-mass objects around almost all of our target stars with sensitivity to objects below 3 Jupiter masses in the best cases Constraints on planet populations based on this null result are presented in our Modeling Results paper
We search for frozen water and its processing around young stellar objects (YSOs of class I/II) We try to detect potential regional differences in water ice evolution within YSOs which is relevant to understanding the chemical structure of the progenitors of protoplanetary systems and the evolution of solid materials Water plays an important role as a reaction bed for rich chemistry and is an indispensable requirement for life as known on Earth
We present our analysis of NAOS-CONICA/VLT spectroscopy of water ice at 3um for the TTauri star YLW 16A in the rho-Ophiuchi molecular cloud We obtained spectra for different regions of the circumstellar environment The observed absorption profiles are deconvolved with the mass extinction profiles of amorphous and crystallized ice measured in laboratory
We take into account both absorption and scattering by ice grains Water ice in YLW 16A is detected with optical depths of between tau=1 8 and tau=2 5 The profiles that are measured can be fitted predominantly by the extinction profiles of small grains (0 1um - 0 3um) with a small contribution from large grains (&lt;10%)
However an unambiguous trace of grain growth cannot be found We detected crystallized water ice spectra that have their origin in different regions of the circumstellar environment of the TTauri star YLW 16A The crystallinity increases in the upper layers of the circumstellar disk while only amorphous grains exist in the bipolar envelope
Context The superrotation phenomenon in the atmosphere on Venus has been known since the late 60&#39;s But until now no mechanism proposed has satisfactorily explained this phenomenon Objective The aim of this research is to propose a mechanism until now never considered which could drive the atmosphere of Venus in its superrotation
This mechanism involves the transfer of the transterminator ionospheric flow momentum to the lower atmosphere via pressure waves generated in the cryosphere of Venus The mechanism proposed presents a source of energy sufficiently strong to allow the transfer of energy despite dissipation Method The energy flow which transports the transterminator flow and the energy lost by the viscosity in the superrotating atmosphere were calculated
Both results were compared to establish if there is sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to drive the superrotation Finally the amplitude that the waves should have to be able to obtain the momentum necessary to induce superrotation was calculated Also an experimental model was made presenting some similarities with the process described
Results The calculated power for the transterminator flow is 8 48x10e10 W The calculated viscous dissipation of the superrotating flow is 1 4x10e9 W Therefore there is sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to maintain superrotation The amplitude of the waves generated in the cryosphere necessary to deposit the power dissipated by the viscous forces
is 10e-4 m for waves of 1 Hz and 10e-8 m for waves of 10e4 Hz These amplitudes imply that at the altitude of the clouds on the night side there must be a constant sound of 83 dB If the superrotation of Venus were to stop with the continuous injection of 1
Debris disks are optically thin almost gas-free dusty disks observed around a significant fraction of main-sequence stars older than about 10 Myr Since the circumstellar dust is short-lived the very existence of these disks is considered as evidence that dust-producing planetesimals are still present in mature systems in which planets have formed - or failed to form - a long time ago
It is inferred that these planetesimals orbit their host stars at asteroid to Kuiper-belt distances and continually supply fresh dust through mutual collisions This review outlines observational techniques and results on debris disks summarizes their essential physics and theoretical models and then places them into the general context of planetary systems
We present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the transiting exoplanetary system WASP-3 Spectra obtained during two separate transits exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and allow us to estimate the sky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis lambda = 3 3^{+2 5}_{-4 4} degrees This alignment between the axes suggests that WASP-3b has a low orbital inclination relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star
During our first night of spectroscopic measurements we observed an unexpected redshift briefly exceeding the expected sum of the orbital and RM velocities by 140 m/s This anomaly could represent the occultation of material erupting from the stellar photosphere although it is more likely to be an artifact caused by moonlight scattered into the spectrograph
Radial velocity measurements of stellar reflex motion have revealed many extrasolar planets but gaps in the observations produce aliases spurious frequencies that are frequently confused with the planets&#39; orbital frequencies In the case of Gl 581 d the distinction between an alias and the true frequency was the distinction between a frozen
dead planet and a planet possibly hospitable to life (Udry et al 2007; Mayor et al 2009) To improve the characterization of planetary systems we describe how aliases originate and present a new approach for distinguishing between orbital frequencies and their aliases Our approach harnesses features in the spectral window function to compare the amplitude and phase of predicted aliases with peaks present in the data
We apply it to confirm prior alias distinctions for the planets GJ 876 d and HD 75898 b We find that the true periods of Gl 581 d and HD 73526 b/c remain ambiguous We revise the periods of HD 156668 b and 55 Cnc e which were afflicted by daily aliases
For HD 156668 b the correct period is 1 2699 days and minimum mass is (3 1 +/- 0 4) Earth masses For 55 Cnc e the correct period is 0 7365 days -- the shortest of any known planet -- and minimum mass is (8 3 +/- 0 3) Earth masses
The (778) Theobalda asteroid family attracted little attention so far but our study shows that it is important in several aspects In this paper we investigate the origin and evolution of Theobalda family Firstly we identify the family as a statistically relevant group in the space of synthetic proper elements
Using the hierarchical clustering method and adopted cut-off velocity of d_{cutoff}=85 m/s we found that Theobalda family currently consists of 128 members This family is located in the outer belt near proper semi-major axis a_{p}~3 175 au This region is crossed by several three-body mean motion resonances which give rise to significant chaotic zones
Consequently the majority of family members reside on chaotic orbits Using two independent methods chaotic chronology and backward integration we found Theobalda family to be only 6 9 +/- 2 3 Myr old We have also estimated that the family was likely produced by the cratering impact on a parent body of diameter D_{PB}~78 +/- 9 km
Two populations of minor bodies in the outer Solar System remain particularly elusive Scattered Disk objects and Sedna-like objects These populations are important dynamical tracers and understanding the details of their spatial- and size-distributions will enhance our understanding of the formation and on-going evolution of the Solar System By using newly-derived limits on the maximum heliocentric distances that recent pencil-beam surveys for Trans-Neptunian Objects were sensitive to
Comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) was observed with the Japanese infrared satellite AKARI in the near-infrared at a post-perihelion heliocentric distance of 1 7 AU Observations were performed with the spectroscopic (2 5--5 0 micron) and imaging (2 4 3 2 and 4 1 micron) modes on 2009 March 30 and 31 UT
respectively AKARI images of the comet exhibit a sunward crescent-like shape coma and a dust tail extended toward the anti-solar direction The 4 1 micron image (CO/CO2 and dust grains) shows a distribution different from the 2 4 and 3 2 micron images (H2O and dust grains) The observed spectrum shows distinct bands at 2
attributed to H2O and CO2 respectively This is the fifth comet in which CO2 has been directly detected in the near-infrared spectrum In addition CO at 4 67 micron and a broad 3 2--3 6 micron emission band from C-H bearing molecules were detected in the AKARI spectrum The relative abundance ratios CO2/H2O and CO/H2O derived from the molecular production rates are \sim 4%--5% and &lt; 2%
We present two independent homogeneous global analyses of the transit light curves radial velocities and spectroscopy of Kepler-4b through Kepler-8b with numerous differences over the previous methods These include 1) improved decorrelated parameter fitting set 2) new limb darkening coefficients 3) time-stamps modified to BJD for consistency with RV 4) two different methods for compensating for the integration-time of Kepler LC-data
durations depths and baseline fluxes for individual transits We make several new determinations 1) We detect a secondary eclipse for Kepler-7b of depth (47+/-14)ppm and significance 3 5-sigma We conclude reflected light is a more plausible origin than thermal emission and determine a geometric albedo of Ag=(0 38+/-0 12) 2) An eccentric-orbit model for the Neptune-mass planet Kepler-4b is marginally detected to 2-sigma confidence with e=(0
If confirmed this would place Kepler-4b in a similar category as GJ436b and HAT-P-11b as an eccentric Neptune-mass planet 3) We find marginal (2-sigma) evidence for Kepler-5b&#39;s secondary eclipse of depth (26+/-17)ppm The most plausible explanation is reflected light caused by a planet with Ag=(0 15+/-0 10) 4) A 2
We find that a resonant/non-resonant perturber Trojan or exomoon all provide inadequate explanations and the most likely source is stellar rotation 5) We find different impact parameters relative to the discovery papers in most cases but generally self-consistent 6) We constrain the presence of resonant planets exomoons and Trojans using transit timing
The location of M dwarfs in the V-K_s--M_Ks color-magnitude diagram (CMD) has been shown to correlate with metallicity We demonstrate that previous empirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this correlation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the extremes of their range We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways
We use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs from the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood we use theoretical models of M dwarf interiors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD
and we base our final calibration purely on high-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions As a result we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the calibration sample than previous photometric calibrations We non-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs that host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane populated by metal-rich M dwarfs
We find that the probability p that planet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD in the same way as field M dwarfs is p = 0 06 +/- 0 008 Interestingly the subsample of M dwarfs that host Neptune and sub-Neptune mass planets may also be preferentially located in the region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane populated by high-metallicity M dwarfs
The probability of this occurrence by chance is p = 0 40 +/- 0 02 and this observation hints that low-mass planets may be more likely to be found around metal-rich M dwarfs An increased rate of low-mass planet occurrence around metal-rich M dwarfs would be a natural consequence of the core-accretion model of planet formation
Of the 26 transiting exoplanet systems with measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect eight have now been found to be significantly spin-orbit misaligned in the plane of the sky Unfortunately the RM effect only measures the angle between the orbit of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star projected in the plane of sky
leaving unconstrained the compliment misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star along the line of sight I use a simple model of stellar rotation benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify ten exoplanet systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of misalignment along the line of sight between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star
I find that HAT-P-7 HAT-P-14 HAT-P-16 HD 17156 Kepler-5 Kepler-7 TrES-4 WASP-1 WASP-12 and WASP-14 are likely spin-orbit misaligned along the line of sight All ten systems have host stellar masses M_star in the range 1 2 M_sun &lt;= M_star &lt;= 1 5 M_sun and the probability of this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand
In addition the planets in the candidate misaligned systems are preferentially massive and eccentric The coupled distribution of misalignment from the RM effect and from this anaylsis suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be spin-orbit aligned than expected given predictions for a transiting planet population produced entirely by planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles and tidal friction
For that reason there are likely two populations of close-in exoplanet systems a population of aligned systems and a population of apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems with massive stars and planets (abridged)
We use thermodynamic calculations to model atmospheric chemistry on terrestrial exoplanets that are hot enough for chemical equilibira between the atmosphere and lithosphere as on Venus The results of our calculations place constraints on abundances of spectroscopically observable gases the surface temperature and pressure and the mineralogy of the surface
We present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified with the Kepler spacecraft These five systems show transits from multiple exoplanet candidates Should these objects prove to be planetary in nature then these five systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide new insights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems
We discuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from the Kepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that have been applied to these data One system shows transits from three distinct objects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects Three systems have planet candidates that are near mean motion commensurabilities---two near 2
We discuss the implications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbital inclinations in planetary systems and hence their dynamical histories; as well as their likely masses and chemical compositions A Monte Carlo study indicates that with additional data most of these systems should exhibit detectable transit timing variations (TTV) due to gravitational interactions---though none are apparent in these data
We assess the ability of a solid ring to model a global perturbation induced by several thousands of main-belt asteroids The ring is first studied in an analytical framework that provides an estimate of all the ring&#39;s parameters excepting mass In the second part numerically estimated perturbations on the Earth-Mars
Earth-Venus and Earth-Mercury distances induced by various subsets of the main-belt population are compared with perturbations induced by a ring To account for large uncertainties in the asteroid masses we obtain results from Monte Carlo experiments based on asteroid masses randomly generated according to available data and the statistical asteroid model
The radius of the ring is analytically estimated at 2 8 AU A systematic comparison of the ring with subsets of the main belt shows that after removing the 300 most perturbing asteroids the total main-belt perturbation of the Earth-Mars distance reaches on average 246 m on the 1969-2010 time interval
A ring with appropriate mass is able to reduce this effect to 38 m We show that by removing from the main belt ~240 asteroids that are not necessarily the most perturbing ones the corresponding total perturbation reaches on average 472 m but the ring is able to reduce it down to a few meters
In the spring of 2009 the Kepler Mission commenced high-precision photometry on nearly 156 000 stars to determine the frequency and characteristics of small exoplanets conduct a guest observer program and obtain asteroseismic data on a wide variety of stars On 15 June 2010 the Kepler Mission released data from the first quarter of observations
At the time of this publication 706 stars from this first data set have exoplanet candidates with sizes from as small as that of the Earth to larger than that of Jupiter Here we give the identity and characteristics of 306 released stars with planetary candidates Data for the remaining 400 stars with planetary candidates will be released in February 2011
Giant planets are usually thought to form within a few tens of AU of their host stars and hence it came as a surprise when we found what appeared to be a planetary mass (~0 008 Msun) companion around the 5 Myr-old solar mass star 1RXS J160929 1-210524 in the Upper Scorpius association
At the time we took the object&#39;s membership in Upper Scorpius -- established from near-infrared H- and K-band spectroscopy -- and its proximity (2 2&#34; or 330 AU) to the primary as strong evidence for companionship but could not verify their common proper motion Here we present follow-up astrometric measurements that confirm that the companion is indeed co-moving with the primary star
which we interpret as evidence that it is a truly bound planetary mass companion We also present new J-band spectroscopy and 3 0-3 8 microns photometry of the companion Based on a comparison with model spectra these new measurements are consistent with the previous estimate of the companion effective temperature of 1800+/-200 K
We present a new estimate of the companion mass based on evolution models and the calculated bolometric luminosity of the companion; we obtain a value of 0 008 (-0 002/+0 003) Msun again consistent with our previous result Finally we present angular differential imaging observations of the system allowing us to rule out additional planets in the system more massive than 1
We calculate radial migration rates of protoplanets in laminar minimum mass solar nebula discs using three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) models The protoplanets are free to migrate whereupon their migration rates are measured For low mass protoplanets (10-50 M_\oplus) we find increases in the migration timescales of up to an order of magnitude between locally-isothermal and RHD models
In the high-mass regime the migration rates are changed very little These results are arrived at by calculating migration rates in locally-isothermal models before sequentially introducing self-gravity and radiative transfer allowing us to isolate the effects of the additional physics We find that using a locally-isothermal equation of state without self-gravity
we reproduce the migration rates obtained by previous analytic and numerical models We explore the impact of different protoplanet models and changes to their assumed radii upon migration The introduction of self-gravity gives a slight reduction of the migration rates whilst the inertial mass problem which has been proposed for high mass protoplanets with circumplanetary discs
is reproduced Upon introducing radiative transfer to models of low mass protoplanets (\approx 10 M_\oplus) modelled as small radius accreting point masses we find outward migration with a rate of approximately twice the analytic inward rate However when modelling such a protoplanet in a more realistic manner with a surface which enables the formation of a deep envelope
Microlensing light curves are typically computed either by ray-shooting maps or by contour integration via Green&#39;s theorem We present an improved version of the second method that includes a parabolic correction in Green&#39;s line integral In addition we present an accurate analytical estimate of the residual errors which allows the implementation of an optimal strategy for the contour sampling
The Eurybates family is a compact core inside the Menelaus clan located in the L4 swarm of Jupiter Trojans Fornasier et al (2007) found that this family exhibits a peculiar abundance of spectrally flat objects similar to Chiron-like Centaurs and C-type main belt asteroids On the basis of the visible spectra available in literature
Eurybates family&#39;s members seemed to be good candidates for having on their surfaces water/water ice or aqueous altered materials To improve our knowledge of the surface composition of this peculiar family we carried out an observational campaign at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) obtaining near-infrared spectra of 7 members Our data show a surprisingly absence of any spectral feature referable to the presence of water
Planet migration is the process by which a planet&#39;s orbital radius changes in time The main agent for causing gas giant planet migration is the gravitational interaction of the young planet with the gaseous disk from which it forms We describe the migration rates resulting from these interactions based on a simple model for disk properties
These migration rates are higher than is reasonable for planet survival We discuss some proposed models for which the migration rates are lower There are major uncertainties in migration rates due to a lack of knowledge about the detailed physical properties of disks We also describe some additional forms of migration
We use a general circulation model to study the three-dimensional (3-D) flow and temperature distributions of atmospheres on tidally synchronized extrasolar planets In this work we focus on the sensitivity of the evolution to the initial flow state which has not received much attention in 3-D modeling studies We find that different initial states lead to markedly different distributions-even under the application of strong forcing (large day-night temperature difference with a short &#34;thermal drag time&#34;) that may be representative of close-in planets
This is in contrast with the results or assumptions of many published studies In general coherent jets and vortices (and their associated temperature distributions) characterize the flow and they evolve differently in time depending on the initial condition If the coherent structures reach a quasi- stationary state their spatial locations still vary
We present results of direct imaging observations for HAT-P-7 taken with the Subaru HiCIAO and the Calar Alto AstraLux Since the close-in transiting planet HAT-P-7b was reported to have a highly tilted orbit massive bodies such as giant planets brown dwarfs or a binary star are expected to exist in the outer region of this system
We show that there are indeed two candidates for distant faint stellar companions around HAT-P-7 We discuss possible roles played by such companions on the orbital evolution of HAT-P-7b We conclude that as there is a third body in the system as reported by Winn et al (2009 ApJL 763
The so-called &#34;Charming Ringlet&#34; (R/2006 S3) is a low-optical-depth dusty ringlet located in the Laplace gap in the Cassini Division This ringlet is particularly interesting because its radial position varies systematically with longitude relative to the Sun in such a way that the ringlet&#39;s geometric center appears to be displaced away from Saturn&#39;s center in a direction roughly toward the Sun
In other words the ringlet is always found at greater distances from the planet&#39;s center at longitudes near the sub-solar longitude than it is at longitudes near Saturn&#39;s shadow This &#34;heliotropic&#34; behavior indicates that the dynamics of the particles in this ring are being influenced by solar radiation pressure In order to investigate this phenomenon
which has been predicted theoretically but has never been observed this clearly we analyze multiple image sequences of this ringlet obtained by Cassini in order to constrain its shape and orientation These data can be fit reasonably well with a model in which both the eccentricity and the inclination of the ringlet have &#34;forced&#34; components (that maintain a fixed orientation relative to the Sun) as well as &#34;free&#34; components (that drift around the planet at steady rates determined by Saturn&#39;s oblateness)
We present evidence for a correlation between the observed properties of hot Jupiter emission spectra and the activity levels of the host stars measured using Ca II H &amp; K emission lines We find that planets with dayside emission spectra that are well-described by standard 1D atmosphere models with water in absorption (HD 189733
TrES-1 TrES-3 WASP-4) orbit chromospherically active stars while planets with emission spectra that are consistent with the presence of a strong high-altitude temperature inversion and water in emission orbit quieter stars We estimate that active G and K stars have Lyman alpha fluxes that are typically a factor of 4-7 times higher than quiet stars with analogous spectral types
and propose that the increased UV flux received by planets orbiting active stars destroys the compounds responsible for the formation of the observed temperature inversions In this paper we also derive a model-independent method for differentiating between these two atmosphere types using the secondary eclipse depths measured in the 3
The space telescope CoRoT searches for transiting extrasolar planets by continuously monitoring the optical flux of thousands of stars in several fields of view We report the discovery of CoRoT-10b a giant planet on a highly eccentric orbit (e=0 53 +/- 0 04) revolving in 13 24 days around a faint (V=15
We use CoRoT photometry radial velocity observations taken with the HARPS spectrograph and UVES spectra of the parent star to derive the orbital stellar and planetary parameters We derive a radius of the planet of 0 97 +/- 0 07 R_Jup and a mass of 2 75 +/- 0 16 M_Jup
The bulk density rho_pl=3 70 +/- 0 83 g/cm^3 is ~2 8 that of Jupiter The core of CoRoT-10b could contain up to 240 M_Earth of heavy elements Moving along its eccentric orbit the planet experiences a 10 6-fold variation in insolation Owing to the long circularisation time tau_circ &gt; 7 Gyr
(Abridged) The Edgeworth-Kuiper belt with its presumed dusty debris is a natural reference for extrsolar debris disks We employ a new algorithm to eliminate the inclination and the distance selection effects in the known TNO populations to derive expected parameters of the &#34;true&#34; EKB Its estimated mass is M_EKB=0 12 M_earth
which is by a factor of \sim 15 larger than the mass of the EKB objects detected so far About a half of the total EKB mass is in classical and resonant objects and another half is in scattered ones Treating the debiased populations of EKB objects as dust parent bodies
we then &#34;generate&#34; their dust disk with our collisional code Apart from accurate handling of collisions and direct radiation pressure we include the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag which cannot be ignored for the EKB dust disk Outside the classical EKB the radial profile of the optical depth approximately follows tau \sim r^-2 which is roughly intermediate between the slope predicted analytically for collision-dominated (r^-1
The cross section-dominating grain size still lies just above the blowout size (\sim 1 2 \microm) as it would without the P-R transport However if the EKB were by one order of magnitude less massive the optical depth profile would fall off as tau \sim r^-3 and the cross section-dominating grain size would shift from \sim 1
These properties are seen if dust is assumed to be generated only by known TNOs If the solar system were observed from outside the thermal emission flux from the EKB dust would be about two orders of magnitude lower than for solar-type stars with the brightest known infrared excesses observed from the same distance
We report the discovery of WASP-21b a new transiting exoplanet discovered by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) Consortium and established and characterized with the FIES SOPHIE CORALIE and HARPS fiber-fed echelle spectrographs A 4 3-d period 1 1% transit depth and 3 4-h duration are derived for WASP-21b using SuperWASP-North and high precision photometric observations at the Liverpool Telescope
Simultaneous fitting to the photometric and radial velocity data with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure leads to a planet in the mass regime of Saturn With a radius of 1 07 R_Jup and mass of 0 30 M_Jup WASP-21b has a density close to 0 24 rho_Jup corresponding to the distribution peak at low density of transiting gaseous giant planets
Tides may be crucial to the habitability of exoplanets If such planets form around low-mass stars then those in the circumstellar habitable zone will be close enough to their host stars to experience strong tidal forces Tides may result in orbital decay and circularization evolution toward zero obliquity a fixed rotation rate (not necessarily synchronous)
and substantial internal heating Due to tidal effects the range of habitable orbital locations may be quite different from that defined by the traditional concept of a habitable zone (HZ) based on stellar insolation atmospheric effects and liquid water on a planet&#39;s surface Tidal heating may make locations within the traditional HZ too hot
Numerical simulations of dispersive turbulence in magnetized plasmas based on the Hall-MHD description are presented assuming spatial variations along a unique direction making a prescribed angle with the ambient magnetic field Main observations concern the energy transfers among the different scales and the various types of MHD waves together with the conditions for the establishment of pressure-balanced structures
For parallel propagation Alfvén-wave transfer to small scales is strongly inhibited and rather feeds magnetosonic modes unless the effect of dispersion is strong enough at the energy injection scale In oblique directions the dominantly compressible character of the turbulence is pointed out with for quasi-transverse propagation the presence of conspicuous kinetic Alfvén waves
Exoplanets are often found with short periods or high eccentricities and multiple-planet systems are often in resonance They require dynamical theories that describe more extreme motions than those of the relatively placid planetary orbits of the Solar System We describe the most important dynamical processes in fully-formed planetary systems and how they are modeled
Here we show that the ~10 Myr Beta Pictoris system hosts a massive giant planet Beta Pictoris b located 8 to 15 AU from the star This result confirms that gas giant planets form rapidly within disks and validates the use of disk structures as fingerprints of embedded planets Among the few planets already imaged
Both Uranus and Neptune are thought to have strong zonal winds with velocities of several hundred meters per second These wind velocities however assume solid-body rotation periods based on Voyager 2 measurements of periodic variations in the planets&#39; radio signals and of fits to the planets&#39; magnetic fields; 17 24h and 16
respectively The realization that the radio period of Saturn does not represent the planet&#39;s deep interior rotation and the complexity of the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune raise the possibility that the Voyager 2 radio and magnetic periods might not represent the deep interior rotation periods of the ice giants
Moreover if there is deep differential rotation within Uranus and Neptune no single solid-body rotation period could characterize the bulk rotation of the planets We use wind and shape data to investigate the rotation of Uranus and Neptune The shapes (flattening) of the ice giants are not measured but only inferred from atmospheric wind speeds and radio occultation measurements at a single latitude
The inferred oblateness values of Uranus and Neptune do not correspond to bodies rotating with the Voyager rotation periods Minimization of wind velocities or dynamic heights of the 1 bar isosurfaces constrained by the single occultation radii and gravitational coefficients of the planets leads to solid-body rotation periods of ~16
Uranus might be rotating faster and Neptune slower than Voyager rotation speeds We derive shapes for the planets based on these rotation rates Wind velocities with respect to these rotation periods are essentially identical on Uranus and Neptune and wind speeds are slower than previously thought Alternatively if we interpret wind measurements in terms of differential rotation on cylinders there are essentially no residual atmospheric winds
A significant fraction of the mature FGK stars have cool dusty disks at least an orders of magnitudes brighter than the solar system&#39;s outer zodiacal light Since such dusts must be continually replenished they are generally assumed to be the collisional fragments of residual planetesimals analogous to the Kuiper Belt objects
At least 10% of solar type stars also bear gas giant planets The fraction of stars with known gas giants or detectable debris disks (or both) appears to increase with the stellar mass Here we examine the dynamical evolution of systems of long-period gas giant planets and residual planetesimals as their host stars evolve off the main sequence
lose mass and form planetary nebula around remnant white dwarf cores The orbits of distant gas giant planets and super-km-size planetesimals expand adiabatically During the most intense AGB mass loss phase sub-meter-size particles migrate toward their host stars due to the strong hydrodynamical drag by the intense stellar wind Along their migration paths
gas giant planets capture and sweep up sub-km-size planetesimals onto their mean-motion resonances These planetesimals also acquire modest eccentricities which are determined by the mass of the perturbing planets the rate and speed of stellar mass loss The swept-up planetesimals undergo disruptive collisions which lead to the production of grains with an extended size range
The radiation drag on these particles is ineffective against the planets&#39; resonant barrier and they form 30-to-150-AU-sizes rings which can effective reprocess the stellar irradiation in the form of FIR continuum We identify the recently discovered dust ring around the white dwarf WD 2226-210 at the center of the Helix nebula as a prototype of such disks and suggest such rings may be common
We consider the capture of galactic dark matter by the Solar System due to the gravitational three-body interaction of the Sun a planet and a dark matter particle Simple estimates are presented for the capture cross-section as well as for density and velocity distribution of captured dark matter particles close to the Earth
As part of the long-term radial velocity monitoring of known transiting planets -- designed to measure orbital eccentricities spin-orbit alignments and further planetary companions -- we have acquired radial velocity data for the two transiting systems WASP-12 and WASP-14 each harbouring gas giants on close orbits (orbital period of 1
In both cases the initial orbital solution suggested a significant orbital eccentricity 0 049+-0 015 for WASP-12 and 0 091+-0 003 for WASP-14 Since then measurements of the secondary eclipse of WASP-12 in the infrared have indicated that one projection of the eccentricity (e cos w) was very close to zero
casting doubt on the eccentricity from the initial radial velocity orbit Our measurements confirm that the initial eccentricity detection could be spurious and show that the radial velocity data is compatible with a circular orbit A MCMC analysis taking into account the presence of correlated systematic noise in both the radial velocity and photometric data gives e=0
The discovery of multi-planet extrasolar systems has kindled interest in using their orbital evolution as a probe of planet formation Accurate descriptions of planetary orbits identify systems which could hide additional planets or be in a special dynamical state and inform targeted follow-up observations We combine published radial velocity data with Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses in order to obtain an ensemble of masses
semimajor axes eccentricities and orbital angles for each of 5 dynamically active multi-planet systems HD 11964 HD 38529 HD 108874 HD 168443 and HD 190360 We dynamically evolve these systems using 52 000 long-term N-body integrations that sample the full range of possible line-of-sight and relative inclinations and we report on the system stability
secular evolution and the extent of the resonant interactions We find that planetary orbits in hierarchical systems exhibit complex dynamics and can become highly eccentric and maybe significantly inclined Additionally we incorporate the effects of general relativity in the long-term simulations and demonstrate that can qualitatively affect the dynamics of some systems with high relative inclinations
We present here three transit observations of HAT-P-9b taken on 14 February 2010 18 February 2010 and 05 April 2010 UT from the University of Arizona&#39;s 1 55 meter Kuiper telescope on Mt Bigelow Our transit light curves were obtained in the I filter for all our observations and underwent the same reduction process
All three of our transits deviated significantly (approximately 24 minutes earlier) from the ephemeris of Shporer et al (2008) However due to the large time span between our observed transits and those of Shporer et al (2008) a 6 5 second (2 sigma) shift downwards in orbital period from the value of Shporer et al
To determine the physical parameters of a transiting planet and its host star from photometric and spectroscopic analysis it is essential to independently measure the stellar mass This is often achieved by the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones but the mass result is only as reliable as the models used
The recent paper by Torres et al (2009) showed that accurate values for stellar masses and radii could be obtained from a calibration using T_eff log g and [Fe/H] We investigate whether a similarly good calibration can be obtained by substituting log rho - the fundamental parameter measured for the host star of a transiting planet - for log g
and apply this to star-exoplanet systems We perform a polynomial fit to stellar binary data provided in Torres et al (2009) to obtain the stellar mass and radius as functions of T_eff log rho and [Fe/H] with uncertainties on the fit produced from a Monte Carlo analysis We apply the resulting equations to measurements for seventeen SuperWASP host stars
and also demonstrate the application of the calibration in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to obtain accurate system parameters where spectroscopic estimates of effective stellar temperature and metallicity are available We show that the calibration using log rho produces accurate values for the stellar masses and radii; we obtain masses and radii of the SuperWASP stars in good agreement with isochrone analysis results
We report the discovery of a transiting planet orbiting the star TYC 6446-326-1 The star WASP-22 is a moderately bright (V=12 0) solar-type star (Teff = 6000 +/- 100 K [Fe/H] = -0 05 +/- 0 08) The lightcurve of the star obtained with the WASP-South instrument shows periodic transit-like features with a depth of about 1 and a duration of 0
The presence of a transit-like feature in the lightcurve is confirmed using z-band photometry obtained with Faulkes Telescope South High resolution spectroscopy obtained with the CORALIE and HARPS spectrographs confirm the presence of a planetary mass companion with an orbital period of 3 533 days in a near-circular orbit From a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data assuming that the star is a typical main-sequence star we estimate that the planet has a mass M_p = 0
In addition there is a linear trend of 40 m/s/yr in the radial velocities measured over 16 months from which we infer the presence of a third body with a long period orbit in this system The companion may be a low mass M-dwarf a white dwarf or a second planet
Transmission spectroscopy at UV wavelengths is a rich and largely unexplored source of information about the upper atmospheres of extrasolar planets So far UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen oxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b The interpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the absorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar radiation and stellar wind
or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe Here we introduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of extrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H Ly alpha and the OI triplet emission lines The results indicate that the mean temperature of the thermosphere is 8
which correspond to an altitude of 1 1 Rp The upper boundary of the model thermosphere is located at altitudes between 2 7-3 Rp above which the atmosphere is mostly ionized We find that the HI transit depth reflects the optical depth of the thermosphere in the wings of the H Ly alpha line but that the atmosphere also overflows the Roche lobe
By assuming a solar mixing ratio of oxygen we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with the observations An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the HI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic escape the O/H ratio is supersolar
An algorithm for creating synthetic telescope images of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) density fields is presented which utilises the adaptive nature of the SPH formalism in full The imaging process uses Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) methods to model the scattering and absorption of photon packets in the density field
which then exit the system and are captured on a pixelated image plane creating a 2D image (or a 3D datacube if the photons are also binned by their wavelength) The algorithm is implemented on the density field directly no gridding of the field is required allowing the density field to be described to an identical level of accuracy as the simulations that generated it
It is known that most of the craters on the surface of the Moon were created by the collision of minor bodies of the Solar System Main Belt Asteroids which can approach the terrestrial planets as a consequence of different types of resonance are actually the main responsible for this phenomenon
Our aim is to investigate the impact distributions on the lunar surface that low-energy dynamics can provide As a first approximation we exploit the hyberbolic invariant manifolds associated with the central invariant manifold around the equilibrium point L_2 of the Earth - Moon system within the framework of the Circular Restricted Three - Body Problem
Taking transit trajectories at several energy levels we look for orbits intersecting the surface of the Moon and we attempt to define a relationship between longitude and latitude of arrival and lunar craters density Then we add the gravitational effect of the Sun by considering the Bicircular Restricted Four - Body Problem
As further exploration we assume an uniform density of impact on the lunar surface looking for the regions in the Earth - Moon neighbourhood these colliding trajectories have to come from It turns out that low-energy ejecta originated from high-energy impacts are also responsible of the phenomenon we are considering
Among other things studies of the formation and evolution of planetary systems currently draw on two important observational resources the precise characterization available for planets that transit their parent stars and the frequency and nature of systems with multiple planets Thus far the study of transiting exoplanets has focused almost exclusively on systems with only one planet
except for considering the influence of additional planets on the transit light curve mostly through transit timing variations (TTVs) This work considers systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star and concludes that such &#34;multi-transiting&#34; systems will be the most information-rich planetary systems besides our own solar system
Five new candidate multi-transiting systems from \emph{Kepler} have been announced in Steffen et al 2010 though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmed as planets In anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi-transiting systems we discuss the value of these systems in detail For example proper interpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved in multi-transiting systems
The true mutual inclination a valuable probe of planetary formation can also be well determined in certain systems especially through Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of each planet In addition such systems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events where one planet crosses over the other which allow for unique constraints on various physical and orbital parameters
Using one-dimensional thermochemical/photochemical kinetics and transport models we examine the chemistry of nitrogen-bearing species in the Jovian troposphere in an attempt to explain the low observational upper limit for HCN We track the dominant mechanisms for interconversion of N2-NH3 and HCN-NH3 in the deep hightemperature troposphere and predict the rate-limiting step for the quenching of HCN at cooler tropospheric altitudes
Consistent with other investigations that were based solely on time-scale arguments our models suggest that transport-induced quenching of thermochemically derived HCN leads to very small predicted mole fractions of hydrogen cyanide in Jupiter&#39;s upper troposphere By the same token photochemical production of HCN is ineffective in Jupiter&#39;s troposphere CH4-NH3 coupling is inhibited by the physical separation of the CH4 photolysis region in the upper stratosphere from the NH3 photolysis and condensation region in the troposphere
(abridged) When preplanetary bodies reach proportions of ~1 km or larger in size their accretion rate is enhanced due to gravitational focusing (GF) We have developed a new numerical model to calculate the collisional evolution of the gravitationally-enhanced growth stage We validate our approach against existing N-body and statistical codes
Using the numerical model we explore the characteristics of the runaway growth and the oligarchic growth accretion phases starting from an initial population of single planetesimal radius R_0 In models where the initial random velocity dispersion (as derived from their eccentricity) starts out below the escape speed of the planetesimal bodies
the system experiences runaway growth We find that during the runaway growth phase the size distribution remains continuous but evolves into a power-law at the high mass end consistent with previous studies Furthermore we find that the largest body accretes from all mass bins; a simple two component approximation is inapplicable during this stage
However with growth the runaway body stirs up the random motions of the planetesimal population from which it is accreting Ultimately this feedback stops the fast growth and the system passes into oligarchy where competitor bodies from neighboring zones catch up in terms of mass Compared to previous estimates we find that the system leaves the runaway growth phase at a somewhat larger radius
Furthermore we assess the relevance of small single-size fragments on the growth process In classical models where the initial velocity dispersion of bodies is small these do not play a critical role during the runaway growth; however in models that are characterized by large initial relative velocities due to external stirring of their random motions
We perform axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations that describe the nonlinear outcome of the viscous overstability in dense planetary rings These simulations are particularly relevant for Cassini observations of fine-scale structure in Saturn&#39;s A and B-ring which take the form of periodic microstructure on the 0 1 km scale and irregular larger-scale structure on 1-10 km
Nonlinear wavetrains dominate all the simulations and we associate them with the observed periodic microstructure The waves can undergo small chaotic fluctuations in their phase and amplitude and may be punctuated by more formidable `wave defects&#39; distributed on longer scales It is unclear however whether the defects are connected to the irregular larger-scale variations observed by Cassini
The long-term behaviour of the simulations is dominated by the imposed boundary conditions and more generally by the limitations of the local model we use the shearing box When periodic boundary conditions are imposed the system eventually settles on a uniform travelling wave of a predictable wavelength while reflecting boundaries
We report the detection of a large mass planet orbiting around the K0 metal-rich subgiant HD38801 ($V=8 26$) by precise radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Subaru Telescope and the Keck Telescope The star has a mass of $1 36M_{\odot}$ and metallicity of [Fe/H]= +0 26 The RV variations are consistent with a circular orbit with a period of 696
Gravitational and electronic forces produce a correlation between the mass and shape of objects in the universe For example at an average radius of ~ 200 km - 300 km the icy moons and rocky asteroids of our Solar System transition from a rounded potato shape to a sphere We derive this potato-to-sphere transition radius -- or &#34;potato radius&#34; -- from first principles
Using the empirical potato radii of asteroids and icy moons we derive a constraint on the yield strength of these bodies during their formative years when their shapes were determined Our proposed ~ 200 km potato radius for icy moons would substantially increase the number of trans-Neptunian objects classified as dwarf planets
Rectified diameters and albedo estimates of 1517 main belt asteroid selected from the IRAS and MSX asteroid photometry catalogues are derived from updated infrared thermal models the Standard Thermal Model (STM) and the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) and Monte Carlo simulations using new Minor Planet Center (MPC) compilations of absolute magnitudes (H-values) constrained by occultation and radar derived parameters
The NEATM approach produces a more robust estimate of albedos and diameters yielding albedos of $p_{v}$(NEATM mean)$=0 081 \pm 0 064$ The asteroid beaming parameter ($\eta$) for the selected asteroids has a mean value of $1 07 \pm 0 27$ and the smooth distribution of $\eta$ suggests that this parameter is independent of asteroid properties such as composition
Orcus is an intermediate-size 1000km-scale Kuiper Belt Object in 3 2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in an orbit very similar to that of Pluto We present visible and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy obtained with the Keck 10m-telescope and the Gemini 8m-telescope We confirm the unambiguous detection of crystalline water ice as well as absorption in the 2
Both in the visible and near-infrared Orcus&#39; spectral properties appear to be homogeneous over time (and probably rotation) at the resolution available From Hapke radiative transfer models involving intimate mixtures of various ices we find for the first time that ammonium (NH+4) and traces of ethane (C2 H6) which are most probably solar irradiation products of ammonia and methane
and a mixture of methane and ammonia (diluted or not) are the best candidates to improve the description of the data with respect to a simple water ice mixture (Haumea type surface) The possible more subtle structure of the 2 2\mu m band(s) should be investigated thoroughly in the future for Orcus and other intermediate size Plutinos to better understand the methane and ammonia chemistry at work
if any We investigated the thermal history of Orcus with a new 3D thermal evolution model Simulations over 4 5 x109 yrs with an input 10% porosity bulk composition of 23% amorphous water ice and 77% dust and cold accretion show that even with the action of long-lived radiogenic elements only
Orcus should have a melted core and most probably suffered a cryovolcanic event in its history which brought large amounts of crystalline ice to the surface The presence of ammonia in the interior would strengthen the melting process The crystalline water ice possibly brought to the surface by a past cryovolcanic event sbe detectable after several billion years despite the irradiation eects
Extrasolar planet host stars have been found to be enriched in key planet-building elements These enrichments have the potential to drastically alter the composition of material available for terrestrial planet formation Here we report on the combination of dynamical models of late-stage terrestrial planet formation within known extrasolar planetary systems with chemical equilibrium models of the composition of solid material within the disk
This allows us to determine the bulk elemental composition of simulated extrasolar terrestrial planets A wide variety of resulting planetary compositions are found ranging from those that are essentially &#34;Earth-like&#34; containing metallic Fe and Mg-silicates to those that are dominated by graphite and SiC This shows that a diverse range of terrestrial planets may exist within extrasolar planetary systems
Gas giant planets play a fundamental role in shaping the orbital architecture of planetary systems and in affecting the delivery of volatile materials to terrestrial planets in the habitable zones Current theories of gas giant planet formation rely on either of two mechanisms the core accretion model and the disk instability model
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will operate in frequency ranges often used by military radar and other communications technology It has been shown that if Extraterrestrial Intelligences (ETIs) communicate using similar technology then the SKA should be able to detect such transmissions up to distances of ~100 pc (~300 light years) from Earth
However Mankind has greatly improved its communications technology over the last century dramatically reducing signal leakage and making the Earth &#34;radio quiet&#34; If ETIs follow the same pattern as the human race will we be able to detect their signal leakage before they become radio quiet? We investigate this question using Monte Carlo Realisation techniques to simulate the growth and evolution of intelligent life in the Galaxy
We show that if civilisations are &#34;human&#34; in nature (i e they are only &#34;radio loud&#34; for ~100 years and can only detect each other with an SKA-like instrument out to 100 pc within a maximum communication time of 100 years) then the probability for such civilisations accidentally detecting each other is low (~10^{-7})
We present results of 6 years of observations reduced and analyzed with the same tools in a systematic way We report completely new data for 15 objects for 5 objects we present a new analysis of previously published results plus additional data and for 9 objects we present a new analysis of data already published
Lightcurves possible rotation periods and photometric amplitudes are reported for all of them The photometric variability is smaller than previously thought the mean amplitude of our sample is 0 1mag and only around 15% of our sample has a larger variability than 0 15mag The smaller variability than previously thought seems to be a bias of previous observations
We find a very weak trend of faster spinning objects towards smaller sizes which appears to be consistent with the fact that the smaller objects are more collisionally evolved but could also be a specific feature of the Centaurs the smallest objects in our sample We also find that the smaller the objects
the larger their amplitude which is also consistent with the idea that small objects are more collisionally evolved and thus more deformed Average rotation rates from our work are 7 5h for the whole sample 7 6h for the TNOs alone and 7 3h for the Centaurs All of them appear to be somewhat faster than what one can derive from a compilation of the scientific literature and our own results
Maxwellian fits to the rotation rate distribution give mean values of 7 5h (for the whole sample) and 7 3h (for the TNOs only) Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium we can determine densities from our sample under the additional assumption that the lightcurves are dominated by shape effects which is likely not realistic
We carry out global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating accretion discs to determine if and under what conditions a disc may fragment to form giant planets We explore the parameter space (in terms of the disc opacity temperature and size) and include the effect of stellar irradiation We find that the disc opacity plays a vital role in determining whether a disc fragments
Specifically opacities that are smaller than interstellar Rosseland mean values promote fragmentation (even at small radii R &lt; 25AU) since low opacities allow a disc to cool quickly This may occur if a disc has a low metallicity or if grain growth has occurred With specific reference to the HR 8799 planetary system
given its star is metal-poor our results suggest that the formation of its imaged planetary system could potentially have occurred by gravitational instability We also find that the presence of stellar irradiation generally acts to inhibit fragmentation (since the discs can only cool to the temperature defined by stellar irradiation)
Various possibilities are currently under discussion to explain the observed weakness of the intrinsic magnetic field of planet Mercury One of the possible dynamo scenarios is a dynamo with feedback from the magnetosphere Due to its weak magnetic field Mercury exhibits a small magnetosphere whose subsolar magnetopause distance is only about 1
We consider the magnetic field due to magnetopause currents in the dynamo region Since the external field of magnetospheric origin is antiparallel to the dipole component of the dynamo field a negative feedback results For an alpha-omega-dynamo two stationary solutions of such a feedback dynamo emerge one with a weak and the other with a strong magnetic field
The question however is how these solutions can be realized To address this problem we discuss various scenarios for a simple dynamo model and the conditions under which a steady weak magnetic field can be reached We find that the feedback mechanism quenches the overall field to a low value of about 100 to 150 nT if the dynamo is not driven too strongly
An important goal within the quest for detecting an Earth-like extrasolar planet will be to identify atmospheric gaseous bio-signatures Observations of the light transmitted through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere as for an extrasolar planet will be the first step for future comparisons We have completed observations of the Earth during a Lunar eclipse
a unique situation similar to that of a transiting planet We aim at showing what species could be detected in its atmosphere at optical wavelengths where a lot of photons are available in the masked stellar light We present observations of the 2008 August 16 Moon eclipse performed with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence
Locating the spectrograph fibers in the penumbra of the eclipse the Moon irradiance is then a mix of direct unabsorbed Sun light and solar light that has passed through the Earth&#39;s limb This mixture essentially reproduces what is recorded during the transit of an extrasolar planet We report here the clear detection of several Earth atmospheric compounds in the transmission spectra
such as ozone molecular oxygen and neutral sodium as well as molecular nitrogen and oxygen through the Rayleigh signature Moreover we present a method that allows us to derive the thickness of the atmosphere versus the wavelength for penumbra eclipse observations We quantitatively evaluate the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes transparent for important species like molecular oxygen and ozone
two species thought to be tightly linked to the presence of life The molecular detections presented here are an encouraging first attempt necessary to better prepare for the future of extremely-large telescopes and transiting Earth-like planets Instruments like SOPHIE will be mandatory when characterizing the atmospheres of transiting Earth-like planets from the ground and searching for bio-marker signatures
We present a comparative study of the thermal emission of the transiting exoplanets WASP-1b and WASP-2b using the Spitzer Space Telescope The two planets have very similar masses but suffer different levels of irradiation and are predicted to fall either side of a sharp transition between planets with and without hot stratospheres
WASP-1b is one of the most highly irradiated planets studied to date We measure planet/star contrast ratios in all four of the IRAC bands for both planets (3 6-8 0um) and our results indicate the presence of a strong temperature inversion in the atmosphere of WASP-1b particularly apparent at 8um
and no inversion in WASP-2b In both cases the measured eclipse depths favor models in which incident energy is not redistributed efficiently from the day side to the night side of the planet We fit the Spitzer light curves simultaneously with the best available radial velocity curves and transit photometry in order to provide updated measurements of system parameters
We do not find significant eccentricity in the orbit of either planet suggesting that the inflated radius of WASP-1b is unlikely to be the result of tidal heating Finally by plotting ratios of secondary eclipse depths at 8um and 4 5um against irradiation for all available planets we find evidence for a sharp transition in the emission spectra of hot Jupiters at an irradiation level of 2 x 10^9 erg/s/cm^2
(Abreviated) Continued radial velocity monitoring of the nearby M4V red dwarf star GJ~876 with Keck/HIRES has revealed the presence of a Uranus-mass fourth planetary companion in the system The new planet has a mean period of $P_e=126 6$ days (over the 12 6-year baseline of the radial velocity observations) and a minimum mass of $m_e\sin{i_e}=12
M_{\oplus}$ Self-consistent N-body fits to the radial velocity data set show that the four-planet system has an invariable plane with an inclination relative to the plane of the sky of $i=59 5^{\circ}$ The fit is not significantly improved by the introduction of a mutual inclination between the planets ``b&#39;&#39; and ``c
&#39;&#39; but the new data do confirm a non-zero eccentricity $e_d=0 207\pm0 055$ for the innermost planet ``d &#39;&#39; In our best-fit coplanar model the mass of the new component is $m_e=14 6\pm1 7\ M_{\oplus}$ Our best-fitting model places the new planet in a 3-body resonance with the previously known giant planets (which have mean periods of $P_c=30
The critical argument $\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=\lambda_c-3\lambda_b+2\lambda_e$ for the Laplace resonance librates with an amplitude of $\Delta\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=40\pm13^{\circ}$ about $\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=0^{\circ}$ Numerical integration indicates that the four-planet system is stable for at least a billion years (at least for the coplanar cases) This resonant configuration of three giant planets orbiting an M-dwarf primary differs from the well-known Laplace configuration of the three inner Galilean satellites of Jupiter
We report the detection of a Jupiter-mass planet discovered with the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1 93-m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory The new planet orbits HD109246 a G0V star slightly more metallic than the Sun HD109246b has a minimum mass of 0 77 MJup an orbital period of 68 days
and an eccentricity of 0 12 It is placed in a sparsely populated region of the period distribution of extrasolar planets We also present a correction method for the so-called seeing effect that affects the SOPHIE radial velocities We complement this discovery announcement with a description of some calibrations that are implemented in the SOPHIE automatic reduction pipeline
We develop a simple model of planetary formation focusing our attention on those planets with masses less than 10 Earth masses and studying particularly the primordial spin parameters of planets resulting from the accretion of planetesimals and produced by the collisions between the embryos As initial conditions we adopt the oligarchic growth regime of protoplanets in a disc where several embryos are allowed to form
We take different initial planetary system parameters and for each initial condition we consider an evolution of 20 millon of years of the system We perform simulations for 1000 different discs and from their results we derive the statistical properties of the assembled planets We have taken special attention to the planetary obliquities and rotation periods
such as the information obtained from the mass and semi major axis diagram which reflects the process of planetary formation The distribution of obliquities was found to be isotropic which means that planets can rotate in direct or indirect sense regardless of their mass Our results regarding the primordial rotation periods show that they are dependent on the region where the embryo was formed and evolved
Planet formation and migration in accretion discs is a very active topic Among the many aspects related to that question dead zones are of particular importance as they can influence both the formation and the migration of planetary embryos The ionisation level in the disc is the key element in determining the existence and the location of the dead zone
This has been studied either within the Standard Accretion Disc (SAD) framework or using parametric discs In this paper we extend this study to the case of Jet Emitting Discs (JED) the structure of which strongly differ from SADs because of the new energy balance and angular momentum extraction imposed by the jets
We make use of the (r z) density distributions provided by self-similar accretion-ejection models along with the JED thermal structure derived in a previous paper to create maps of the ionisation structure of JEDs We compare the ionisation rates we obtain to the critical value required to trigger the magneto-rotational instability
It is found that JEDs have a much higher ionisation degree than SADs which renders very unlikely the presence of a dead zone in these discs As JEDs are believed to occupy the inner regions of accretion discs the extension of the dead zones published in the literature should be re-considered for systems in which a jet is present
We report the discovery of WASP-26b a moderately over-sized Jupiter-mass exoplanet transiting its 11 3-magnitude early-G-type host star (1SWASP J001824 70-151602 3; TYC 5839-876-1) every 2 7566 days A simultaneous fit to transit photometry and radial-velocity measurements yields a planetary mass of 1 02 +/- 0 03 M_Jup and radius of 1
The host star WASP-26 has a mass of 1 12 +/- 0 03 M_sun and a radius of 1 34 +/- 0 06 R_sun and is in a visual double with a fainter K-type star The two stars are at least a common-proper motion pair with a common distance of around 250 +/- 15 pc and an age of 6 +/- 2 Gy
We present a Spitzer InfraRed Spectrometer search for 10-36 micron molecular emission from a large sample of protoplanetary disks including lines from H2O OH C2H2 HCN and CO2 This paper describes the sample and data processing and derives the detection rate of mid-infrared molecular emission as a function of stellar mass
The sample covers a range of spectral type from early M to A and is supplemented by archival spectra of disks around A and B stars It is drawn from a variety of nearby star forming regions including Ophiuchus Lupus and Chamaeleon In total we identify 22 T Tauri stars with strong mid-infrared H2O emission
Integrated water line luminosities where water vapor is detected range from 5x10^-4 to 9x10^-3 Lsun likely making water the dominant line coolant of inner disk surfaces in classical T Tauri stars None of the 5 transitional disks in the sample show detectable gaseous molecular emission with Spitzer upper limits at the 1% level in terms of line-to-continuum ratios (apart from H2)
We find a strong dependence on detection rate with spectral type; no disks around our sample of 25 A and B stars were found to exhibit water emission down to 1-2% line-to-continuum ratios in the mid-infrared while almost 2/3 of the disks around K stars show sufficiently intense water emission to be detected by Spitzer
Some Herbig Ae/Be stars show tentative H2O/OH emission features beyond 20 micron at the 1-2 level however and one of them shows CO2 in emission We argue that the observed differences between T Tauri disks and Herbig Ae/Be disks is due to a difference in excitation and/or chemistry depending on spectral type and suggest that photochemistry may be playing an important role in the observable characteristics of mid-infrared molecular line emission from protoplanetary disks
For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method the spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass-estimate of the star and subsequently of the orbiting planet In contrast if also the orbital velocity of the planet would be known the masses of both star and planet could be determined directly using Newton&#39;s law of gravity
just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries Here we report on the detection of the orbital velocity of extrasolar planet HD209458b High dispersion ground-based spectroscopy during a transit of this planet reveals absorption lines from carbon monoxide produced in the planet atmosphere which shift significantly in wavelength due to the change in the radial component of the planet orbital velocity
These observations result in a mass determination of the star and planet of 1 00+-0 22 Msun and 0 64+-0 09 Mjup respectively A ~2 km/sec blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0
We present high-precision photometry of three transits of the extrasolar planetary system WASP-2 obtained by defocussing the telescope and achieving point-to-point scatters of between 0 42 and 0 73 mmag These data are modelled using the JKTEBOP code and taking into account the light from the recently-discovered faint star close to the system
The physical properties of the WASP-2 system are derived using tabulated predictions from five different sets of stellar evolutionary models allowing both statistical and systematic errorbars to be specified We find the mass and radius of the planet to be M_b = 0 847 +/- 0 038 +/- 0 024 Mjup and R_b = 1
It has a low equilibrium temperature of 1280 +/- 21 K in agreement with a recent finding that it does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion The first of our transit datasets has a scatter of only 0 42 mmag with respect to the best-fitting light curve model which to our knowledge is a record for ground-based observations of a transiting extrasolar planet
Our goal is to understand primary accretion of the first planetesimals The primitive meteorite record suggests that sizeable planetesimals formed in the asteroid belt over a period longer than a million years each composed entirely of an unusual but homogeneous mixture of mm-size particles We sketch a scenario in which primary accretion of 10-100km size planetesimals proceeds directly
if sporadically from aerodynamically-sorted mm-size particles (generically &#34;chondrules&#34;) These planetesimal sizes are in general agreement with the currently observed asteroid mass peak near 100km diameter which has been identified as a &#34;fossil&#34; property of the pre-erosion pre-depletion population We extend our primary accretion theory to make predictions for outer solar system planetesimals
which may also have a preferred size in the 100km diameter range We estimate formation rates of planetesimals and assess the conditions needed to match estimates of both asteroid and Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) formation rates For nebula parameters that satisfy observed mass accretion rates of Myr-old protoplanetary nebulae the scenario is roughly consistent with not only the &#34;fossil&#34; sizes of the asteroids
and their estimated production rates but also with the observed spread in formation ages of chondrules in a given chondrite and with a tolerably small radial diffusive mixing during this time between formation and accretion (the model naturally helps explain the peculiar size distribution of chondrules within such objects) The scenario also produces 10-100km diameter primary KBOs
We perform linear analysis of axisymmetric vertical normal modes in stratified compressible self-gravitating polytropic discs in the shearing box approximation We study specific dynamics for subadiabatic adiabatic and superadiabatic vertical stratifications In the absence of self-gravity four well-known principal modes can be identified in a stratified disc acoustic p- surface gravity f-
buoyancy g- and inertial r-modes After characterizing modes in the non-self-gravitating case we include self-gravity and investigate how it modifies the properties of these modes We find that self-gravity to a certain degree reduces their frequencies and changes the structure of the dispersion curves and eigenfunctions at radial wavelengths comparable to the disc height
Its influence on the basic branch of the r-mode in the case of subadiabatic and adiabatic stratifications and on the basic branch of the g-mode in the case of superadiabatic stratification (which in addition exhibits convective instability) does appear to be strongest Reducing the three-dimensional Toomre&#39;s parameter Q_{3D} results in the latter modes becoming unstable due to self-gravity
so that they determine the onset criterion and nature of gravitational instability of a stratified disc By contrast the p- f- and convectively stable g-modes although their corresponding \omega^2 are reduced by self-gravity never become unstable however small the value of Q_{3D} This is a consequence of the three-dimensionality of the disc
The eigenfunctions corresponding to the gravitationally unstable modes are intrinsically 3D We also contrast the more exact instability criterion based on our 3D model with that of density waves in 2D (razor-thin) discs Based on these findings we comment on the origin of surface distortions seen in numerical simulations of self-gravitating discs
Transit search programs such as CoRoT and Kepler now have the capability of detecting planets as small as the Earth The detection of these planets however requires the removal of all false positives Although many false positives can be identified by a detailed analysis of the LCs the detections of others require additional observations
An important source of false positives are faint eclipsing binaries within the PSF of the target stars We develop a new method that allows us to detect faint eclipsing binaries with a separation smaller than one arcsec from target stars We thereby focus on binaries that mimic the transits of terrestrial planets
These binaries can be either at the same distance as the target star (triple stars) or at either larger or smaller distances A close inspection of the problem indicates that in all relevant cases the binaries are brighter in the infrared than in the optical regime We show how high resolution IR spectroscopy can be used to remove these false positives
For the triple star case we find that the brightness difference between a primary and an eclipsing secondary is about 9-10 mag in the visual but only about 4 5-5 9 magnitudes in the K-band We demonstrate how the triple star hypothesis can be excluded by taking a high-resolution IR spectrum
Simulations of these systems show that the companions can be detected with a false-alarm probability of 2% if the spectrum has a S/N-ratio &gt; 100 We show that high-resolution IR spectra also allows to detect most of the false positives caused by foreground or background binaries If high resolution IR spectroscopy is combined with photometric methods
The stellar rotation periods of ten exoplanet host stars have been determined using newly analysed Ca II H &amp; K flux records from Mount Wilson Observatory and Stromgren b y photometric measurements from Tennessee State University&#39;s automatic photometric telescopes (APTs) at Fairborn Observatory Five of the rotation periods have not previously been reported
with that of HD 130322 very strongly detected at Prot = 26 1 \pm 3 5 d The rotation periods of five other stars have been updated using new data We use the rotation periods to derive the line-of-sight inclinations of the stellar rotation axes which may be used to probe theories of planet formation and evolution when combined with the planetary orbital inclination found from other methods
Finally we estimate the masses of fourteen exoplanets under the assumption that the stellar rotation axis is aligned with the orbital axis We calculate the mass of HD 92788 b (28 MJ) to be within the low-mass brown dwarf regime and suggest that this object warrants further investigation to confirm its true nature
We present new optical broadband colors obtained with the Keck 1 and Vatican Advanced Technology telescopes for six objects in the inner classical Kuiper Belt Objects in the inner classical Kuiper Belt are of interest as they may represent the surviving members of the primordial Kuiper Belt that formed interior to the current position of the 3
the current position of the plutinos or alternatively they may be objects formed at a different heliocentric distance that were then moved to their present locations The six new colors combined with four previously published show that the 10 inner belt objects with known colors form a neutral clump and a reddish clump in B-R color
Nonparametric statistical tests show no significant difference between the B-R color distribution of the inner disk objects compared to the color distributions of Centaurs plutinos or scattered disk objects However the B-R color distribution of the inner classical Kuiper belt objects does differ significantly from the distribution of colors in the cold (low inclination) main classical Kuiper belt
The cold main classical objects are predominately red while the inner classical belt objects are a mixture of neutral and red The color difference may reveal the existence of a gradient in the composition and /or surface processing history in the primordial Kuiper Belt or indicate that the inner disk objects are not dynamically analogous to the cold main classical belt objects
Cassini radio science experiments have provided multiple occultation optical depth profiles of Saturn&#39;s rings that can be used in combination to analyze density waves This paper establishes an accurate procedure of inversion of the wave profiles to reconstruct the wave kinematic parameters as a function of semi-major axis in the nonlinear regime
This procedure is achieved from simulated data in the presence of realistic noise perturbations to control the reconstruction error By way of illustration we have applied our procedure to the Mimas 5 3 density wave We were able to recover precisely the kinematic parameters from the radio experiment occultation data in most of the propagation region; a preliminary analysis of the pressure-corrected dispersion allowed us to determine new but still uncertain values for the opacity ($K\simeq 0
Our procedure constitutes the first step in our planned analysis of the density waves of Saturn&#39;s rings It is very accurate and efficient in the far-wave region However improvements are required within the first wavelength The ways in which this method can be used to establish diagnostics of ring physics are outlined
We present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanet HD80606b Using the Spitzer Space Telescope and its IRAC camera on the post-cryogenic mission we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation of HD80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 January 2010 We complement this photometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously performed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory
This provides radial velocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously uncovered with spectroscopy This new data set allows the parameters of this singular planetary system to be significantly refined We obtained a planet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0 1001 +/- 0 0006 that is slightly lower than the one measured from previous ground observations
We detected a feature in the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot We also found a transit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; this could be caused by actual TTVs due to an additional body in the system or by underestimated systematic uncertainties
The sky-projected angle between the spin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to be lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively rejected Over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles
a few of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two different evolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems depending if they experienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body As in the case of HD80606b most of the planetary systems including a massive planet are tilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario for massive planets in comparison with Jupiter-mass planets
(Abridged) Studies of debris discs have shown that most systems are analogous to the EKB In this study we aim to determine how many IRAS 25um excesses towards A stars are real and investigate where the dust lies We observe with TIMMI2 VISIR Michelle and TReCS a sample of A and B-type main sequence stars reported as having mid-IR excess
We constrain the location of the debris through combined modelling of the emission spectrum and a modelling technique designed to constrain the radial extent of emission in mid-IR imaging We independently confirm the presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates HD3003 HD80950 and eta Tel For the binary HD3003 a stability analysis indicates the dust is either circumstellar and lying at ~4 AU with the binary orbiting at &gt;14AU
or the dust lies in an unstable location; there is some evidence for temporal evolution of its excess emission on a ~20 year timescale For 7 of the targets we present quantitative limits on the location of dust around the star We demonstrate that the disc around HD71155 must have spatially distinct components at 2 and 60AU
We model the limits of current instrumentation and show that most of the known A star debris discs which could be readily resolved at 18um on 8m instruments have been resolved Limits from unresolved imaging can help distinguish between competing models of the disc emission but resolved imaging is key to the determination of the disc location
Modelling of the detection limits for extended emission can be useful for targeting future observational campaigns MIRI on the JWST will be able to resolve most of the known A star debris disc population METIS on the E-ELT will provide the opportunity to explore the hot disc population more thoroughly by detecting extended emission where calibration accuracy limits disc detection through photometry
The dust ejecta of Main-Belt Comet P/2010 A2 (LINEAR) have been observed with several telescopes at the at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on La Palma Spain Application of an inverse dust tail Monte Carlo method to the images of the dust ejecta from the object indicates that a sustained
likely water-ice driven activity over some eight months is the mechanism responsible for the formation of the observed tail The total amount of dust released is estimated to be 5E7 kg which represents about 0 3% of the nucleus mass While the event could have been triggered by a collision
We investigate the formation of terrestrial planets in the late stage of planetary formation using two-planet model At that time the protostar has formed for about 3 Myr and the gas disk has dissipated In the model the perturbations from Jupiter and Saturn are considered We also consider variations of the mass of outer planet
and the initial eccentricities and inclinations of embryos and planetesimals Our results show that terrestrial planets are formed in 50 Myr and the accretion rate is about 60% - 80% In each simulation 3 - 4 terrestrial planets are formed inside &#34;Jupiter&#34; with masses of $0 15 - 3 6 M_{\oplus}$
In the 0 5 - 4AU when the eccentricities of planetesimals are excited planetesimals are able to accrete material from wide radial direction The plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet in the Habitable Zone may be transferred from the farther places by this mechanism Accretion may also happen a few times between two giant planets only if the outer planet has a moderate mass and the small terrestrial planet could survive at some resonances over time scale of $10^8$ yr
We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the growth and orbital evolution of giant planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk with a dead-zone The aim is to examine to what extent the presence of a dead-zone affects the rates of mass accretion and migration for giant planets We performed 3D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamics code
In these simulations of non-magnetised disks the dead-zone is treated as a region where the vertical profile of the viscosity depends on the distance from the equatorial plane We consider dead-zones with vertical sizes H_dz ranging from 0 to H_dz=2 3H where H is the disk scale-height For all models
the vertically integrated viscous stress and the related mass flux through the disk have the same value such that the simulations test the dependence of planetary mass accretion and migration on the vertical distribution of the viscous stress For each model an embedded 30 earth-masses planet on a fixed circular orbit is allowed to accrete gas from the disk
Once the planet mass becomes equal to that of Saturn or Jupiter we allow the planet orbit to evolve due to gravitational interaction with the disk We find that the time scale over which a protoplanet grows to become a giant planet is essentially independent of the dead-zone size and depends only on the total rate at which the disk viscously supplies material to the planet
For Saturn-mass planets the migration rate depends only weakly on the size of the dead-zone for H_dz&lt; 1 5H but becomes slower when H_dz=2 3H This effect is due to the desaturation of corotation torques which originate from residual material in the partial-gap region For Jupiter-mass planets there is a clear tendency for the migration to proceed more slowly as the size of the dead-zone increases
We present the Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph spectrum of the main-sequence star HD165014 which is a warm (&gt;~ 200 K) debris disk candidate discovered by the AKARI All-Sky Survey The star possesses extremely large excess emission at wavelengths longer than 5 \mum The detected flux densities at 10 and 20 \mum are ~ 10 and ~ 30 times larger than the predicted photospheric emission
respectively The excess emission is attributable to the presence of circumstellar warm dust The dust temperature is estimated as 300-750 K corresponding to the distance of 0 7-4 4 AU from the central star Significant fine-structured features are seen in the spectrum and the peak positions are in good agreement with those of crystalline enstatite
Features of crystalline forsterite are not significantly seen HD165014 is the first debris disk sample that has enstatite as a dominant form of crystalline silicate rather than forsterite Possible formation of enstatite dust from differentiated parent bodies is suggested according to the solar system analog The detection of an enstatite-rich debris disk in the current study suggests the presence of large bodies and a variety of silicate dust processing in warm debris disks
We explore how finite integration times or equivalently temporal binning induces morphological distortions to the transit light-curve These distortions if uncorrected for lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time
These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by for example Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (COROT) and the Kepler Mission (8 5 and 30 min) One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density
which has significant ramifications for transit surveys We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such techniques as a function of integration time and numerical resolution This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence light-curves
We study the stability regions and families of periodic orbits of two planets locked in a co-orbital configuration We consider different ratios of planetary masses and orbital eccentricities also we assume that both planets share the same orbital plane Initially we perform numerical simulations over a grid of osculating initial conditions to map the regions of stable/chaotic motion and identify equilibrium solutions
These results are later analyzed in more detail using a semi-analytical model Apart from the well known quasi-satellite (QS) orbits and the classical equilibrium Lagrangian points L4 and L5 we also find a new regime of asymmetric periodic solutions For low eccentricities these are located at $(\sigma \Delta\omega) = (\pm 60°
\mp 120°)$ where \sigma is the difference in mean longitudes and \Delta\omega is the difference in longitudes of pericenter The position of these Anti-Lagrangian solutions changes with the mass ratio and the orbital eccentricities and are found for eccentricities as high as ~ 0 7 Finally we also applied a slow mass variation to one of the planets
Digital co-addition of astronomical images is a common technique for increasing signal-to-noise and image depth A modification of this simple technique has been applied to the detection of minor bodies in the Solar System first stationary objects are removed through the subtraction of a high-SN template image then the sky motion of the Solar System bodies of interest is predicted and compensated for by shifting pixels in software prior to the co-addition step
This &#34;shift-and-stack&#34; approach has been applied with great success in directed surveys for minor Solar System bodies In these surveys the shifts have been parameterized in a variety of ways However these parameterizations have not been optimized and in most cases cannot be effectively applied to data sets with long observation arcs due to objects&#39; real trajectories diverging from linear tracks on the sky
This paper presents two novel probabilistic approaches for determining a near-optimum set of shift-vectors to apply to any image set given a desired region of orbital space to search The first method is designed for short observational arcs and the second for observational arcs long enough to require non-linear shift-vectors
Using these techniques and other optimizations we derive optimized grids for previous surveys that have used &#34;shift-and-stack&#34; approaches to illustrate the improvements that can be made with our method and at the same time derive new limits on the range of orbital parameters these surveys searched We conclude with a simulation of a future applications for this approach with LSST
We present an analysis of 18 short-cadence (SC) transit lightcurves of TrES-2b using quarter 0 (Q0) and quarter 1 (Q1) from the Kepler Mission The photometry is of unprecedented precision 237ppm per minute allowing for the most accurate determination of the transit parameters yet obtained for this system Global fits of the transit photometry
radial velocities and known transit times are used to obtain a self-consistent set of refined parameters for this system including updated stellar and planetary parameters Special attention is paid to fitting for limb darkening and eccentricity We place an upper limit on the occultation depth to be &lt;72 9ppm to 3-sigma confidence
indicating TrES-2b has the lowest determined geometric albedo for an exoplanet of Ag&lt;0 146 We also produce a transit timing analysis using Kepler&#39;s short-cadence data and demonstrate exceptional timing precision at the level of a few seconds for each transit event With 18 fully-sampled transits at such high precision we are able to produce stringent constraints on the presence of perturbing planets
We investigate the non-resonant 3-D (spatial) model of the hierarchical system composed of point-mass stellar (or sub-stellar) binary and a low-mass companion (a circumbinary planet or a brown dwarf) We take into account the leading relativistic corrections to the Newtonian gravity The secular model of the system relies on the expansion of the perturbing Hamiltonian in terms of the ratio of semi-major axes $\alpha$
averaged over the mean anomalies We found that the low-mass object in a distant orbit may excite large eccentricity of the inner binary when the mutual inclination of the orbits is larger than about of 60 deg This is related to strong instability caused by a phenomenon which acts similarly to the Lidov-Kozai resonance (LKR)
The secular system may be strongly chaotic and its dynamics unpredictable over the long-term time scale Our study shows that in the Jupiter-- or brown dwarf-- mass regime of the low-massive companion the restricted model does not properly describe the long-term dynamics in the vicinity of the LKR The relativistic correction is significant for the parametric structure of a few families of stationary solutions in this problem
in particular for the direct orbits configurations (with the mutual inclination less than 90 degrees) We found that the dynamics of hierarchical systems with small $\alpha \sim 0 01$ may be qualitatively different in the realm of the Newtonian (classic) and relativistic models This holds true even for relatively large masses of the secondaries
(Note this is a shortened version of the original A&amp;A-style structured abstract) The physical nature of the strong photometric variability of T Tau Sa the more massive member of the Southern &#34;infrared companion&#34; to T Tau has long been debated Intrinsic luminosity variations due to variable accretion were originally proposed but later challenged in favor of apparent fluctuations due to time-variable foreground extinction
In this paper we use the timescale of the variability as a diagnostic for the underlying physical mechanism Because the IR emission emerging from Sa is dominantly thermal emission from circumstellar dust at &lt;=1500K we can derive a minimum size of the region responsible for the time-variable emission In the context of the variable foreground extinction scenario
this region must be (un-) covered within the variability timescale which implies a minimum velocity for the obscuring foreground material If this velocity supercedes the local Kepler velocity we can reject foreground extinction as a valid variability mechanism The variable accretion scenario allows for shorter variability timescales since the variations in luminosity occur on much smaller scales
essentially at the surface of the star and the disk surface can react almost instantly on the changing irradiation with a higher or lower dust temperature and according brightness We have detected substantial variations at long wavelengths in T Tau S +26% within four days at 12 8 micron We show that this short-term variability cannot be due to variable extinction and instead must be due to variable accretion
A subcritical transition to turbulence in magnetized Keplerian shear flows is investigated using a statistical approach Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the shearing box equations with zero net magnetic flux are employed to determine the transition from decaying to sustained turbulence as a function of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm The results reveal no clear transition to sustained turbulence as the average lifetime of the transients grows as an exponential function of Rm
We present 1428 individual astrometric measurements of 256 Transneptunian objects made with HST The observations were collected over three years with two instruments the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys High Resolution Camera as part of four HST programs We briefly describe the data and our analysis procedures
The submission of these measurements to the Minor Planet Center increased the individual arc length of objects by 1 83 days to 8 11 years Of the 256 total objects 62 (24 2%) had arc length increases \ge 3 years The arc length for 60 objects (23 4%) was increased by a factor of two or greater
We report the detection of a time variable OVII line emission in a deep 100 ks Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer spectrum of the Galactic Ridge X-ray emission The observed line intensity is too strong (11+/-2 line unit or photon cm^-2 s^-1 str^-1) to be emitted inside the heavily obscured Galactic disk
It showed a factor of two time variation which shows a significant (~4 sigma) correlation with the solar wind O^7+ ion flux The high line intensity and the good time correlation with the solar wind strongly suggests that it originated from geocoronal solar wind charge exchange emission We discuss the X-ray line intensity considering a line of sight direction and also theoretical distribution models of the neutral hydrogen and solar wind around the Earth
Recent sub-millimetric observations at the Plateau de Bure interferometer evidenced a cavity at ~ 46 AU in radius into the proto-planetary disk around the T Tauri star LkCa15 (V1079 Tau) located in the Taurus molecular cloud Additional Spitzer observations have corroborated this result possibly explained by the presence of a massive (&gt;= 5 MJup) planetary mass
a brown dwarf or a low mass star companion at about 30 AU from the star We used the most recent developments of high angular resolution and high contrast imaging to search directly for the existence of this putative companion and to bring new constraints on its physical and orbital properties
The NACO adaptive optics instrument at VLT was used to observe LkCa15 using a four quadrant phase mask coronagraph to access small angular separations at relatively high contrast A reference star at the same parallactic angle was carefully observed to optimize the quasi-static speckles subtraction (limiting our sensitivity at less than 1
Although we do not report any positive detection of a faint companion that would be responsible for the observed gap in LkCa15&#39;s disk (25-30 AU) our detection limits start constraining its probable mass semi-major axis and eccentricity Using evolutionary model predictions Monte Carlo simulations exclude the presence of low eccentric companions with masses M &gt;= 6 M Jup and orbiting at a &gt;= 100 AU with significant level of confidence
For closer orbits brown dwarf companions can be rejected with a detection probability of 90% down to 80 AU (at 80% down to 60 AU) Our detection limits do not access the star environment close enough to fully exclude the presence of a brown dwarf or a massive planet within the disk inner activity (i
The measurement of the light scattered from extrasolar planets informs atmospheric and formation models With the discovery of many hot Jupiter planets orbiting nearby stars this motivates the development of robust methods of characterisation from follow up observations In this paper we discuss two methods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems
First the most widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot Jupiters (Collier Cameron et al ) is investigated for application for typical echelle spectra of a transiting planet system showing that detection requires high signal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets Secondly a new Fourier analysis method is also presented
which is model-independent and utilises the benefits of the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems This approach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in Fourier space by least-squares The sensitivities of the methods are determined via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes We find the Fourier analysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observations of a well constrained transiting system than the Collier Cameron et al
method We apply the Fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered by transiting hot Jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of HD 209458 and HD 189733 Unfortunately we are unable to improve on the previous upper limit of the planet-to-star flux for HD 209458b set by space-based observations
A 1{\sigma}upper limit on the planet-to-star flux of HD 189733b is measured in the wavelength range of 558 83-599 56 nm yielding {\epsilon} &lt; 4 5 \times 10-4 Improvement in the measurement of the upper limit of the planet-to-star flux of this system with ground-based capabilities requires data with a higher signal-to-noise ratio
We propose a method to be able to decide whether the planets of CoRoT-7 are moving on mutually inclined orbits in the order of i &gt; 10 degrees The extrasolar system CoRoT-7 is very special with respect to the closeness of the planets to the host star which results in a fast dynamical development
It would therefore be possible to determine the inclination of the innermost planet CoRoT-7b with respect to the observer after an observation of at least three years from space with the satellite CoRoT with sufficient precision Different inclinations would cause different duration of the transit times of a planet in front of the star and would therefore give us a better knowledge of the architecture of this <a href="http
//system With" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> the aid of numerical integrations and analytical estimations we checked how inclined orbits of additional planets would change the transit duration of CoRoT-7b After 3 years of observations when an additional planet would be on a inclined orbit with respect to CoRoT-7b (I_mutual &gt; 10 degrees) an increase of the order of minutes could be observed for the transit duration
We present numerical computations of the equilibrium configurations of tidally-locked homogeneous binaries rotating in circular orbits Unlike the classical Roche approximations we self-consistently account for the tidal and rotational deformations of both components and relax the assumptions of ellipsoidal configurations and Keplerian rotation We find numerical solutions for mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1
starting at a small angular velocity for which tidal and rotational deformations are small and following a sequence of increasing angular velocities Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche limit&#39;&#39; above which no equilibrium solution can be found Even though the Roche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe&#39;&#39; is filled
any further increase in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss For close comparable-mass binaries we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms may be as large as 10-20% and departures from Keplerian rotation are significant We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium configurations assuming their distance is &gt;&gt;1 AU (e
g in the Kuiper Belt) We consider both backscatter (proportional to the projected area) and diffuse (Lambert) reflections Backscatter reflection always yields two minima of equal depths Diffuse reflection which is sensitive to the surface curvature generally gives rise to unequal minima We find detectable intensity differences of up to 10% between our light curves and those arising from the Roche approximations
Finally we apply our models to Kuiper Belt binary 2001 QG298 and find a nearly edge-on binary with a mass ratio q = 0 93 ^{+0 07}_{-0 03} angular velocity Omega^2/G rho = 0 333+/-0 001 (statistical errors only) and pure diffuse reflection For the observed period of 2001 QG298
We present an analysis of seven primary transit observations of the hot Neptune GJ436b at 3 6 4 5 and $8~\mu$m obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope After correcting for systematic effects we fitted the light curves using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique
Combining these new data with the EPOXI HST and ground-based $V I H$ and $K_s$ published observations the range $0 5-10~\mu$m can be covered Due to the low level of activity of GJ436 the effect of starspots on the combination of transits at different epochs is negligible at the accuracy of the dataset
Representative climate models were calculated by using a three-dimensional pseudo-spectral general circulation model with idealised thermal forcing Simulated transit spectra of GJ436b were generated using line-by-line radiative transfer models including the opacities of the molecular species expected to be present in such a planetary atmosphere A new ab-initio calculated linelist for hot ammonia has been used for the first time
The photometric data observed at multiple wavelengths can be interpreted with methane being the dominant absorption after molecular hydrogen possibly with minor contributions from ammonia water and other molecules No clear evidence of carbon monoxide and dioxide is found from transit photometry We discuss this result in the light of a recent paper where photochemical disequilibrium is hypothesised to interpret secondary transit photometric data
The high spectral resolution and sensitivity of Herschel/HIFI allows for the detection of multiple rotational water lines and accurate determinations of water production rates in comets In this letter we present HIFI observations of the fundamental 110-101 (557 GHz) ortho and 111-000 (1113 GHz) para rotational transitions of water in comet 81P/Wild 2 acquired in February 2010
We mapped the extent of the water line emission with five point scans Line profiles are computed using excitation models which include excitation by collisions with electrons and neutrals and solar infrared radiation We derive a mean water production rate of $1 0 \times 10^{28}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ at a heliocentric distance of 1
Dawn is the first NASA mission to operate in the vicinity of the two most massive asteroids in the main belt Ceres and Vesta This double-rendezvous mission is enabled by the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion Dawn will arrive at Vesta in 2011 and will operate in its vicinity for approximately one year
Vesta&#39;s mass and non-spherical shape coupled with its rotational period presents very interesting challenges to a spacecraft that depends principally upon low-thrust propulsion for trajectory-changing maneuvers The details of Vesta&#39;s high-order gravitational terms will not be determined until after Dawn&#39;s arrival at Vesta but it is clear that their effect on Dawn operations creates the most complex operational environment for a NASA mission to date
Gravitational perturbations give rise to oscillations in Dawn&#39;s orbital radius and it is found that trapping of the spacecraft is possible near the 1 1 resonance between Dawn&#39;s orbital period and Vesta&#39;s rotational period located approximately between 520 and 580 km orbital <a href="http //radius This" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> resonant trapping can be escaped by thrusting at the appropriate orbital phase
Having passed through the 1 1 resonance gravitational perturbations ultimately limit the minimum radius for low-altitude operations to about 400 km in order to safely prevent surface impact The lowest practical orbit is desirable in order to maximize signal-to-noise and spatial resolution of the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Detector and to provide the highest spatial resolution observations by Dawn&#39;s Framing Camera and Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer
More than 450 extrasolar planets are known to date To detect these intriguing objects many photometric and radial velocity (RV) surveys are in progress We developed the Keplerian FITting (KFIT) code to model published and available RV data KFIT is based on a hybrid quasi-global optimization technique relying on the Genetic Algorithms and simplex algorithm
Here we re-analyse the RV data of evolved K3III star HD 240210 We confirm three equally good solutions which might be interpreted as signals of 2-planet systems Remarkably one of these best-fits describes the long-term stable two-planet system involved in the 2 1~mean motion resonance (MMR) It may be the first instance of this strong MMR in a multi-planet system hosted by evolved star
We have extended our earlier work on space weathering of the youngest S-complex asteroid families to include results from asteroid clusters with ages &lt;10^6 years and to newly identified asteroid pairs with ages &lt;5x10^5 years We have identified three S-complex asteroid clusters with ages in the range 10^{5-6} years The average color of the objects in these clusters agree with the prediction of Willman et al
SDSS photometry of the members of very young asteroid pairs with ages &lt;10^5 years was used to determine their taxonomy The average color of the S-complex pairs is PC_1=0 49+/-0 03 over 5-sigma redder than predicted by Willman et al 2008 Therefore the most likely pair formation mechanism is gentle separation due to YORP spin-up leaving much of the aged and reddened surface undisturbed
In this case our color measurement allows us to set an upper limit of ~64% on the disturbed surface portion Using pre-existing color data and our new results for the youngest S-complex asteroid clusters we have extended our space weather model to explicitly include the effects of regolith gardening and fit separate weathering and gardening characteristic timescales of tau_w=960+/-160My and tau_g=2000+/-290My respectively
The first principal component color for fresh S-complex material is 0 37+/-0 01 while the maximum amount of local reddening is 0 33+/-0 06 Our first-ever determination of the gardening time is in stark contrast to our calculated gardening time of tau_g~270My based on main belt impact rates and reasonable assumptions about crater and ejecta blanket sizes
Recent infrared spectroscopy of hot exoplanets is beginning to reveal their atmospheric composition Deep with in the planetary atmosphere the composition is controlled by thermochemical equilibrium Photochemistry becomes important higher in the atmosphere at levels above ~1 bar These two chemistries compete between ~1-10 bars in hot Jupiter-like atmospheres depending on the strength of the eddy mixing and temperature
HD189733b provides an excellent laboratory in which to study the consequences of chemistry of hot atmospheres The recent spectra of HD189733b and HD209458b contain signatures of CH4 CO2 CO and H2O Here we identify the primary chemical pathways that govern the abundances of CH4 CO2 CO and H2O in the cases of thermochemical equilibrium chemistry
We report the discovery of several large &#34;propeller&#34; moons in the outer part of Saturn&#39;s A ring objects large enough to be followed over the 5-year duration of the Cassini mission These are the first objects ever discovered that can be tracked as individual moons but do not orbit in empty space
We infer sizes up to 1--2 km for the unseen moonlets at the center of the propeller-shaped structures though many structural and photometric properties of propeller structures remain unclear Finally we demonstrate that some propellers undergo sustained non-keplerian orbit motion (Note This arXiv version of the paper contains supplementary tables that were left out of the ApJL version due to lack of space)
Proposals for ground-based laser remediation of space debris rely on the creation of appropriately directed ablation-driven impulses to either divert the fragment or drive it into an orbit with a perigee allowing atmospheric capture For a spherical fragment the ablation impulse is a function of the orbital parameters and the laser engagement angle
Water-rich super-Earth exoplanets are expected to be common We explore the effect of late giant impacts on the final bulk abundance of water in such planets We present the results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of impacts between differentiated water(ice)-rock planets with masses between 0 5 and 5 M_Earth and projectile to target mass ratios from 1
We find that giant impacts between bodies of similar composition never decrease the bulk density of the target planet If the commonly assumed maximum water fraction of 75wt% for bodies forming beyond the snow line is correct giant impacts between similar composition bodies cannot serve as a mechanism for increasing the water fraction
Target planets either accrete materials in the same proportion leaving the water fraction unchanged or lose material from the water mantle decreasing the water fraction The criteria for catastrophic disruption of water-rock planets are similar to those found in previous work on super-Earths of terrestrial composition Changes in bulk composition for giant impacts onto differentiated bodies of any composition (water-rock or rock-iron) are described by the same equations
Main sequence M stars pose an interesting problem for astrobiology their abundance in our galaxy makes them likely targets in the hunt for habitable planets but their strong chromospheric activity produces high energy radiation and charged particles that may be detrimental to life We studied the impact of the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf
AD Leonis (AD Leo) simulating the effects from both UV radiation and protons on the atmospheric chemistry of a hypothetical Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone Based on observations of solar proton events and the Neupert effect we estimated a proton flux associated with the flare of $5 9\times 10^{8}$ protons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for particles with energies &gt;10 MeV
Then we calculated the abundance of nitrogen oxides produced by the flare by scaling the production of these compounds during a large solar proton event called the &#34;Carrington event&#34; The simulations were performed using a 1-D photochemical model coupled to a 1-D radiative/convective model Our results indicate that the ultraviolet radiation emitted during the flare does not produce a significant change in the ozone column depth of the planet
When the action of protons is included the ozone depletion reached a maximum of 94% two years after the flare for a planet with no magnetic field At the peak of the flare the calculated UV fluxes that reach the surface in the wavelength ranges that are damaging for life
exceed those received on Earth during less than 100 s Flares may therefore not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet Given that AD Leo is one of the most magnetically-active M dwarfs known this conclusion should apply to planets around other M dwarfs with lower levels of chromospheric activity
Context Repeated observations of exoplanet transits allow us to refine the planetary parameters and probe them for any time dependent variations In particular deviations of the period from a strictly linear ephemeris transit timing variations (TTVs) can indicate the presence of additional bodies in the planetary system <br>Aims Our goal was to reexamine the largely unstudied OGLE2-TR-L9 system with high cadence
multi-color photometry in order to refine the planetary parameters and probe the system for TTVs <br>Methods We observed five full transits of OGLE2-TR-L9 with the GROND instrument at the ESO/MPG 2 2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory GROND is a multichannel imager that allowed us to gather simultaneous light curves in the g&#39;
r&#39; i&#39; and z&#39; filters <br>Results From our analysis we find that the semi-major axis and the inclination differ from the previously published values With the newly observed transits we were able to refine the ephemeris to 2454492 80008(+/- 0 00014) + 2 48553417(+/- 6 4) x 10^-7 E The newly derived parameters are a=0
We present an analytic model for the interaction between planetary atmospheres and stellar winds from main sequence M stars with the purpose of obtaining a quick test-model that estimates the timescale for total atmospheric mass loss due to this interaction Planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs may be tidally locked and may have weak magnetic fields
because of this we consider the extreme case of planets with no magnetic field The model gives the planetary atmosphere mass loss rate as a function of the stellar wind and planetary properties (mass atmospheric pressure and orbital distance) and an entrainment efficiency coefficient $\alpha$ We use a mixing layer model to explore two different cases
a time-independent stellar mass loss and a stellar mass loss rate that decreases with time For both cases we consider planetary masses within the range of $1\to10$ M$_{\oplus}$ and atmospheric pressures with values of 1 5 and 10 atm For the time dependent case planets without magnetic field in the habitable zone of M dwarfs with initial stellar mass losses of $\leq \dot{M}_{w} &lt; 10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
may retain their atmospheres for at least 1 Gyr This case may be applied to early spectral type M dwarfs (earlier than M5) Studies have shown that late type M dwarfs (later than M5) may be active for long periods of time ($\geq 4$Gyr) and because of that our model with constant stellar mass loss rate may be more accurate
For these stars most planets may have lost their atmospheres in 1 Gyr or less because most of the late type M dwarfs are expected to be active We emphasize that our model only considers planets without magnetic fields Clearly we must expect a higher resistance to atmospheric erosion if we include the presence of a magnetic field
The two main components of the closest star system {\alpha}-Centauri AB(RA 14h39m Dec-60o50&#39; J2000 0) is indubitbaly one of the most studied visual double stars This paper presents the results of our recalculation of orbital and physical parameters of the system using Thiele-van den Bos method based on observational data from year 1900 to 2002
In this paper we present the consistent evolution of short-period exoplanets coupling the tidal and gravothermal evolution of the planet Contrarily to previous similar studies our calculations are based on the complete tidal evolution equations of the Hut model valid at any order in eccentricity obliquity and spin We demonstrate
both analytically and numerically that except if the system was formed with a nearly circular orbit (e&lt;0 2) solving consistently the complete tidal equations is mandatory to derive correct tidal evolution histories We show that calculations based on tidal models truncated at second order in eccentricity as done in all previous studies
lead to erroneous tidal evolutions As a consequence tidal energy dissipation rates are severely underestimated in all these calculations and the characteristic timescales for the various orbital parameters evolutions can be wrong by up to three orders in magnitude <br>Based on these complete consistent calculations we revisit the viability of the tidal heating hypothesis to explain the anomalously large radius of transiting giant planets
We show that even though tidal dissipation does provide a substantial contribution to the planet&#39;s heat budget and can explain some of the moderately bloated hot-Jupiters this mechanism can not explain alone the properties of the most inflated objects including HD 209458b Indeed solving the complete tidal equations shows that enhanced tidal dissipation and thus orbit circularization occur too early during the planet&#39;s evolution to provide enough extra energy at the present epoch
GJ436b is a unique member of the transiting extrasolar planet population being one of the smallest and least irradiated and possessing an eccentric orbit Because of its size mass and density GJ436b could plausibly have an atmospheric metallicity similar to Neptune (20-60 times solar abundances) which makes it an ideal target to study the effects of atmospheric metallicity on dynamics and radiative transfer in an extrasolar planetary atmosphere
We present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models that include realistic non-gray radiative transfer for 1 3 10 30 and 50 times solar atmospheric metallicity cases of GJ436b Low metallicity models (1 and 3 times solar) show little day/night temperature variation and strong high-latitude jets In contrast higher metallicity models (30 and 50 times solar) exhibit day/night temperature variations and a strong equatorial jet
Spectra and light curves produced from these simulations show strong orbital phase dependencies in the 50 times solar case and negligible variations with orbital phase in the 1 times solar case Comparisons between the predicted planet/star flux ratio from these models and current secondary eclipse measurements support a high metallicity atmosphere (30-50 times solar abundances) with disequilibrium carbon chemistry at play for GJ436b
We present the results of a wide-field survey using the 1 2-m Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory This survey was designed to find the most distant members of the Kuiper belt and beyond We searched ~12 000 deg2 down to a mean limiting magnitude of 21 3 in R
A total number of 52 KBOs and Centaurs have been detected 25 of which were discovered in this survey Except for the re-detection of Sedna no additional Sedna-like bodies with perihelia greater than 45 AU were detected despite sensitivity out to distances of 1000 AU We discuss the implications for a distant Sedna- like population beyond the Kuiper belt
focusing on the constraints we can place on the embedded stellar cluster environment the early Sun may be have been born in where the location and distribution of Sedna-like orbits sculpted by multiple stellar encounters is indicative of the birth cluster size We also report our observed latitude distribution and implications for the size of the plutino population
Within the next few years the first Earth-mass planets will be discovered around other stars Some of those worlds will certainly lie within the classical &#34;habitable zone&#34; of their parent stars and we will quickly move from knowing of no exoEarths to knowing many For the first time we will be in a position to carry out a detailed search for the first evidence of life beyond our Solar System
However such observations will be hugely taxing and time consuming to perform and it is almost certain that far more potentially habitable worlds will be known than it is possible to study It is therefore important to catalogue and consider the various effects which make a promising planet more or less suitable for the development of life
In this work we review the various planetary dynamical and stellar influences that could influence the habitability of exoEarths The various influences must be taken in concert when we attempt to decide where to focus our first detailed search for life While there is no guarantee that any given planet will be inhabited
We construct a theoretical model for low-temperature crystallization of amorphous silicate grains induced by exothermic chemical reactions As a first step the model is applied to the annealing experiments in which the samples are (1) amorphous silicate grains and (2) amorphous silicate grains covered with an amorphous carbon layer We derive the activation energies of crystallization for amorphous silicate and amorphous carbon from the analysis of the experiments
Furthermore we apply the model to the experiment of low-temperature crystallization of amorphous silicate core covered with an amorphous carbon layer containing reactive molecules We clarify the conditions of low-temperature crystallization due to exothermic chemical reactions Next we formulate the crystallization conditions so as to be applicable to astrophysical environments
We show that the present crystallization mechanism is characterized by two quantities the stored energy density Q in a grain and the duration of the chemical reactions \tau The crystallization conditions are given by Q &gt; Q_{min} and \tau &lt; \tau _{cool} regardless of details of the reactions and grain structure
The formation of planetesimals via gravitational instability of the dust layer in a protoplanetary disks demands that there be local patches where dust is concentrated by a factor of $\sim$ a few $\times 10^3$ over the background value Vortices in protoplanetary disks may concentrate dust to these values allowing them to be the nurseries of planetesimals
The concentration of dust in the cores of vortices increases the dust-gas ratio of the core compared to the background disk creating a &#34;heavy vortex &#34; In this work we show that these vortices are subject to an instability which we have called the heavy-core instability Using Floquet theory we show that this instability occurs in elliptical protoplanetary vortices when the gas-dust density of the core of the vortex is heavier than the ambient gas-dust density by a few tens of percent
The heavy-core instability grows very rapidly with a growth timescale of a few vortex rotation periods While the nonlinear evolution of this instability remains unknown it will likely increase the velocity dispersion of the dust layer in the vortex because instability sets in well before sufficient dust can gather to form a protoplanetary seed
Numerical simulations based on the core-nucleated accretion model are presented for the formation of Jupiter at 5 2 AU in 3 primordial disks with three different assumed values of the surface density of solid particles The grain opacities in the envelope of the protoplanet are computed using a detailed model that includes settling and coagulation of grains and that incorporates a recalculation of the grain size distribution at each point in time and space
We generally find lower opacities than the 2% of interstellar values used in previous calculations [Hubickyj O Bodenheimer P Lissauer J J 2005 Icarus 179 415--431; Lissauer J J Hubickyj O D&#39;Angelo G Bodenheimer P 2009 Icarus 199 338-350] These lower opacities result in more rapid heat loss from and more rapid contraction of the protoplanetary envelope
For a given surface density of solids the new calculations result in a substantial speedup in formation time as compared with those previous calculations Formation times are calculated to be 1 0 1 9 and 4 0 Myr and solid core masses are found to be 16 8 8 9
and 4 7 Earth masses for solid surface densities sigma of 10 6 and 4 grams per squared centimeter respectively For sigma=10 and sigma=6 g/cm^2 respectively these formation times are reduced by more than 50% and more than 80% compared with those in a previously published calculation with the old approximation to the opacity
At the dawn of the first discovery of exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars in the mid-1990s few believed that observations of exoplanet atmospheres would ever be possible After the 2002 Hubble Space Telescope detection of a transiting exoplanet atmosphere many skeptics discounted it as a one-object one-method success Nevertheless the field is now firmly established
with over two dozen exoplanet atmospheres observed today Hot Jupiters are the type of exoplanet currently most amenable to study Highlights include detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day-night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure Atmospheres of giant planets far from their host stars are also being studied with direct imaging
Giant protoplanets formed by gravitational instability in the outer regions of circumstellar disks go through an early phase of quasi-static contraction during which radii are large and internal temperatures are low The main source of opacity in these objects is dust grains We investigate two problems involving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3
and 7 M_J First we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply scale the opacity accordingly We show that higher metallicity results in slower contraction as a result of higher opacity It is found that the pre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity In this scenario
survival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to be more likely around low-metallicity stars since they evolve to the point of collapse to small size on shorter time scales But metal-rich planets as a result of longer contraction times have the best opportunity to capture planetesimals and form heavy-element cores
Second we investigate the effects of opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling for the same three planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity When these processes are included the pre-collapse time scale is found to be of order 1000 years for the three masses
significantly shorter than the time scale calculated without these effects In this case the time scale is found to be relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition However the effects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust which could increase the timescale are not included in the calculation
M-type asteroids as defined in the Tholen taxonomy (Tholen 1984) are medium albedo bodies supposed to have a metallic composition and to be the progenitors both of differentiated iron-nickel meteorites and enstatite chondrites We carried out a spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared wavelength range (0 4-2 5 micron) of 30 asteroids chosen from the population of asteroids initially classified as Tholen M -types
aiming to investigate their surface composition The data were obtained during several observing runs during the years 2004-2007 at the TNG NTT and IRTF telescopes We computed the spectral slopes in several wavelength ranges for each observed asteroid and we searched for diagnostic spectral features We confirm a large variety of spectral behaviors for these objects as their spectra are extended into the near-infrared
including the identification of weak absorption bands mainly of the 0 9 micron band tentatively attributed to orthopyroxene and of the 0 43 micron band that may be associated to chlorites and Mg-rich serpentines or pyroxene minerals such us pigeonite or augite A comparison with previously published data indicates that the surfaces of several asteroids belonging to the M-class may vary significantly
We attempt to constrain the asteroid surface compositions of our sample by looking for meteorite spectral analogues in the RELAB database and by modelling with geographical mixtures of selected meteorites/minerals We confirm that iron meteorites pallasites and enstatite chondrites are the best matches to most objects in our sample as suggested for M-type asteroids
The short-lived radioisotope $^{60}$Fe requires production in a core collapse supernova or AGB star immediately before its incorporation into the earliest solar system solids Shock waves from a somewhat distant supernova or a relatively nearby AGB star have the right speeds to simultaneously trigger the collapse of a dense molecular cloud core and to inject shock wave material into the resulting protostar
A new set of FLASH2 5 adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical models shows that the injection efficiency depends sensitively on the assumed shock thickness and density Supernova shock waves appear to be thin enough to inject the amount of shock wave material necessary to match the short-lived radioisotope abundances measured for primitive meteorites
We test the effect of assumptions about stellar motion on the behavior of gravitational instabilities in protoplanetary disks around solar-type stars by performing two simulations that are identical in all respects except the treatment of the star In one simulation the star is assumed to remain fixed at the center of the inertial reference frame
In the other stellar motion is handled properly by including an indirect potential in the hydrodynamic equations to model the star&#39;s reference frame as one which is accelerated by star/disk interactions The disks in both simulations orbit a solar mass star initially extend from 2 3 to 40 AU with a r^-1/2 surface density profile
and have a total mass of 0 14 M_sun The gamma = 5/3 ideal gas is assumed to cool everywhere with a constant cooling time of two outer rotation periods <br>The overall behavior of the disk evolution is similar except for weakening in various measures of GI activity by about at most tens of percent for the indirect potential case
Overall conclusions about disk evolution in earlier papers by our group where the star was always assumed to be fixed in an inertial frame remain valid There is no evidence for independent one-armed instabilities like SLING in either simulation On the other hand the stellar motion about the system center of mass (COM) in the simulation with the indirect potential is substantial
up to 0 25 AU during the burst phase as GIs initiate and averaging about 0 9 AU during the asymptotic phase when the GIs reach an overall balance of heating and cooling These motions appear to be a stellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes in both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution
and the star&#39;s orbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near the corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves This motion is in principle large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar wobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets orbiting at 10&#39;s AU
We study the dynamics of planetary systems with two planets moving in the same plane when frictional forces act on the two planets in addition to the gravitational forces The model of the general three-body problem is used Different laws of friction are considered The topology of the phase space is essential in understanding the evolution of the system
The topology is determined by the families of stable and unstable periodic orbits both symmetric and non symmetric It is along the stable families or close to them that the planets migrate when dissipative forces act At the critical points where the stability along the family changes there is a bifurcation of a new family of stable periodic orbits and the migration process changes route and follows the new stable family up to large eccentricities or to a chaotic region
We consider both resonant and non resonant planetary systems The 2/1 3/1 and 3/2 resonances are studied The migration to larger or smaller eccentricities depends on the particular law of friction Also in some cases the semimajor axes increase and in other cases they are stabilized For particular laws of friction and for special values of the parameters of the frictional forces
Giant planet embryos are believed to be spawned by gravitational instability in massive extended (R ~ 100 AU) protostellar discs In a recent paper we have shown that dust can sediment inside the embryos as argued earlier by Boss (1998) in a slightly different model Here we study numerically the next stage of this process -- the formation of a solid core
If conditions are conducive to solid core formation the centre of the gas cloud goes through the following sequence of phases (i) becomes grain (and metal) rich; (ii) forms a terrestrial mass solid core via a rapid collapse driven by self-gravity of the grains; (iii) starts to accrete a gaseous atmosphere when the solid core reaches mass of a few to 10 Earth masses
This sequence of events may build either terrestrial planet cores or metal rich giant planets inside the larger gas reservoir of the giant planet embryo In a companion Letter we argue that tidal and irradiation effects from the parent star should disrupt the outer metal poor layers of the embryo
In the context of massive fragmenting protoplanetary discs Boss (1998) suggested that grains can grow and sediment inside giant planet embryos formed at R ~ 5 AU away from the star Several authors since then criticised the suggestion Convection may prevent grain sedimentation and the embryos cannot even form so close to the parent star as cooling is too inefficient at these distances
Here we reconsider the grain sedimentation process suggested by Boss (1998) but inside an embryo formed as expected in the light of the cooling constraints at R ~ 100 AU Such embryos are much less dense and are also cooler We make analytical estimates of the process and also perform simple spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations to test these ideas
We find that convection in our models does not become important before a somewhat massive (~ an Earth mass this is clarified in a followup paper) solid core is built Turbulent mixing slows down dust sedimentation but is overwhelmed by grain sedimentation when the latter grow to a centimetres size
The minimum time required for dust sedimentation to occur is a few thousand years and is a strong function of the embryo&#39;s mass dust content and opacity An approximate analytical criterion is given to delineate conditions in which a giant embryo contracts and heats up faster than dust can sediment
As Boss et al (2002) we argue that core formation through grain sedimentation inside the giant planet embryos may yield an unexplored route to form giant gas and giant ice planets The present model also stands at the basis of paper III where we study the possibility of forming terrestrial planet cores by tidal disruption and photoevaporation of the planetary envelope
In the recent years the &#34;Nice&#34; model of solar system formation has attained an unprecedented level of success in reproducing much of the observed orbital architecture of the solar system by evolving the planets to their current locations from a more compact configuration Within the context of this model the formation of the classical Kuiper belt requires a phase during which the ice giants have a high eccentricity
An outstanding question of this model is the initial configuration from which the Solar System started out Recent work has shown that multi-resonant initial conditions can serve as good candidates as they naturally prevent vigorous type-II migration In this paper we use analytical arguments as well as self-consistent numerical N-body simulations to identify fully-resonant initial conditions
whose dynamical evolution is characterized by an eccentric phase of the ice-giants as well as planetary scattering We find a total of eight such initial conditions Four of these primordial states are compatible with the canonical &#34;Nice&#34; model while the others imply slightly different evolutions The results presented here should prove useful in further development of a comprehensive model for solar system formation
Using the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the {\it Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} we obtained moderate-resolution high signal/noise ultraviolet spectra of HD 209458 and its exoplanet HD 209458b during transit both orbital quadratures and secondary eclipse We compare transit spectra with spectra obtained at non-transit phases to identify spectral features due to the exoplanet&#39;s expanding atmosphere
We find that the mean flux decreased by $7 8\pm 1 3$% for the C II <a href="https //arxiv org/abs/1334 5323" data-arxiv-id="1334 5323" class="link-https">1334 5323</a>Å and <a href="https //arxiv org/abs/1335 6854" data-arxiv-id="1335 6854" class="link-https">1335 6854</a>Å lines and by $8 2\pm 1 4$% for the Si III 1206 500Å line during transit compared to non-transit times in the velocity interval --50 to +50 km s$^{-1}$
Comparison of the C II and Si III line depths and transit/non-transit line ratios shows deeper absorption features near --10 and +15 km s$^{-1}$ and less certain features near --40 and +30--70 km s$^{-1}$ but future observations are needed to verify this first detection of velocity structure in the expanding atmosphere of an exoplanet
Our results for the C II lines and the non-detection of Si IV 1394 76Å absorption are in agreement with \citet{Vidal-Madjar2004} but we find absorption during transit in the Si III line contrary to the earlier result The $8\pm 1$% obscuration of the star during transit is far larger than the 1
Absorption during transit at velocities between --50 and +50 km s$^{-1}$ in the C II and Si III lines requires high-velocity ion absorbers but models that assume that the absorbers are high-temperature thermal ions are inconsistent with the COS spectra Assuming hydrodynamic model values for the gas temperature and outflow velocity at the limb of the outflow as seen in the C II lines
Precision radial velocities from Keck/HIRES reveal a Saturn-mass planet orbiting the nearby M4V star HIP 57050 The planet has a minimum mass of 0 3 Jupiter-mass an orbital period of 41 4 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0 31 V-band photometry reveals a clear stellar rotation signature of the host star with a period of 98 days
well separated from the period of the radial velocity variations and reinforcing a Keplerian origin for the observed velocity variations The orbital period of this planet corresponds to an orbit in the habitable zone of HIP 57050 with an expected planetary temperature of approximately 230 K The star has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0
of order twice solar and among the highest metallicity stars in the immediate solar neighborhood This newly discovered planet provides further support that the well-known planet-metallicity correlation for F G and K stars also extends down into the M-dwarf regime The a priori geometric probability for transits of this planet is only about 1%
However the expected eclipse depth is ~7% considerably larger than that yet observed for any transiting planet Though long on the odds such a transit is worth pursuing as it would allow for high quality studies of the atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy with HST At the expected planetary effective temperature
We present a second paper of fully characterization of a sample of stars whose low-depth transits were discovered by the OGLE-III campaign in order to select the most promising candidates for spectroscopic confirmation following the same analysis done in Gallardo et al (2005) We present new optical and near-IR photometry
deriving physical parameters like effective temperature (Teff) distance (d) the stellar radii (R*) and the companion radii (Rc) We selected eight M (2800 K \le Teff \le 3850 K) or K (3850 K \le Teff \le 5150 K) spectral type stellar objects as potential candidates to host exoplanets even though
considering the radii of their companions only stars OGLE-TR-61 OGLE-TR-74 OGLE-TR-123 and OGLE-TR-173 are the most promising M-type transit candidates to host planets Confirmation of the planetary nature of any of these objects will yield another transiting extrasolar planet orbiting a M-type star or even more interesting the first extrasolar planets orbiting a late M-type dwarf of effective temperature about 2900 K
The fragile structure of chondritic-porous interplanetary dust particles (CP- IDPs) and their minimal parent-body alteration have led researchers to believe these particles originate in comets rather than asteroids where aqueous and thermal alteration have occurred The solar elemental abundances and atmospheric entry speed of CP-IDPs also suggest a cometary origin
With the return of the Stardust samples from Jupiter-family comet 81P/Wild 2 this hypothesis can be tested We have measured the Fe oxidation state of 15 CP-IDPs and 194 Stardust fragments using a synchrotron-based x-ray microprobe We analyzed ~300 nanograms of Wild 2 material - three orders of magnitude more material than other analyses comparing Wild 2 and CP-IDPs
The Fe oxidation state of these two samples of material are &gt;2{\sigma} different the CP-IDPs are more oxidized than the Wild 2 grains We conclude that comet Wild 2 contains material that formed at a lower oxygen fugacity than the parent body or parent bodies of CP-IDPs If all Jupiter-family comets are similar
In recent years a large number of Hot Jupiters orbiting in a very close orbit around the parent stars have been explored with the transit and doppler effect methods Here in this work we study the gravitational microlensing effect of a binary lens on a parent star with a Hot Jupiter revolving around it
Caustic crossing of the planet makes enhancements on the light curve of the parent star in which the signature of the planet can be detected by high precision photometric observations We use the inverse ray shooting method with tree code algorithm to generate the combined light curve of the parent star and the planet
In order to investigate the probability of observing the planet signal we do a Monte-Carlo simulation and obtain the observational optical depth of $\tau \sim 10^{-8}$ We show that about ten years observations of Galactic Bulge with a network of telescopes will enable us detecting about ten Hot Jupiter with this method
The Athena MHD code has been extended to integrates the motion of particles coupled with the gas via aerodynamic drag in order to study the dynamics of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks and the formation of planetesimals Our particle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second order predictor-corrector method
Careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact conservation The hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimes relevant to protoplanetary disks We describe a semi-implicit integrator generalized from the leap-frog approach In the absence of drag force it preserves the geometric properties of a particle orbit
We also present a fully-implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes of particle-gas coupling Using our hybrid code we study the numerical convergence of the non-linear saturated state of the streaming instability We find that gas flow properties are well converged with modest grid resolution (128 cells per pressure length \eta r for dimensionless stopping time tau_s=0
and equal number of particles and grid cells On the other hand particle clumping properties converge only at higher resolutions and finer resolution leads to stronger clumping before convergence is reached Finally we find that measurement of particle transport properties resulted from the streaming instability may be subject to error of about 20%
Scattered lights from terrestrial exoplanets provide valuable information about the planetary surface Applying the surface reconstruction method proposed by Fujii et al (2010) to both diurnal and annual variations of the scattered light we develop a reconstruction method of land distribution with both longitudinal and latitudinal resolutions We find that one can recover a global map of an idealized Earth-like planet on the following assumptions
and 7) no moon Using the dependence of light curves on the planetary obliquity we also show that the obliquity can be measured by adopting the chi-square minimization or the extended information criterion We demonstrate a feasibility of our methodology by applying it to a multi-band photometry of a cloudless model Earth with future space missions such as the occulting ozone observatory (O3)
We analyze the dynamics of individual kilometer-size planetesimals in circumstellar orbits of a tight binary system We include both the gravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag stemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate We consider several precession rates and eccentricities for the gas
and compare the results with a static disk in circular orbit <br>The disk precession introduces three main differences with respect to the classical static case (i) The equilibrium secular solutions generated by the gas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system but limit cycles with frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas
The amplitude of the cycle is inversely dependent on the body size reaching negligible values for $\sim 50$ km size planetesimals (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable by small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and the forced eccentricity and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for planetesimals strongly coupled with the gas
(iii) The characteristic timescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with increasing precession rates with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller than for static disks <br>Finally we apply this analysis to the $\gamma$-Cephei system and estimate impact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity
The study of multiple extrasolar planetary systems has the opportunity to obtain constraints for the planetary masses and orbital inclinations via the detection of mutual perturbations The analysis of precise radial velocity measurements might reveal these planet-planet interactions and yields a more accurate view of such planetary systems Like in the generic data modelling problems
a fit to radial velocity data series has a set of unknown parameters of which parametric derivatives have to be known by both the regression methods and the estimations for the uncertainties In this paper an algorithm is described that aids the computation of such derivatives in case of when planetary perturbations are not neglected
The application of the algorithm is demonstrated on the planetary systems of HD 73526 HD 128311 and HD 155358 In addition to the functions related to radial velocity analysis the actual implementation of the algorithm contains functions that computes spatial coordinates velocities and barycentric coordinates for each planet These functions aid the joint analysis of multiple transiting planetary systems
Stellar activity has a particularly strong influence on planets at small orbital distances such as close-in exoplanets For such planets we present two extreme cases of stellar variability namely stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar wind which both result in the planetary environment being variable on a timescale of billions of years
For both cases direct interaction of the streaming plasma with the planetary atmosphere would entail servere consequences In certain cases however the planetary atmosphere can be effectively shielded by a strong planetary magnetic field The efficiency of this shielding is determined by the planetary magnetic dipole moment which is difficult to constrain by either models or observations
Turbulent two-dimensional hydrodynamic flows are characterized by the emergence of coherent long-lived vortices without a need to invoke special initial conditions Vortices have the ability to sequester particles with typical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm that are slightly decoupled from the gas A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature profiles that are decreasing
power-law functions of radial distance is that four vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size In particular two of the zones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small particles reside Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale near and at the boundaries of this annulus
As the disc ages and the particles grow via coagulation the size of the annulus shrinks Older discs prefer to capture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time a phenomenon we term &#34;vortex aging&#34; More viscous more dust-opaque and/or less massive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of particle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc
Thus how efficiently a disc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between coagulation and vortex aging If vortices form in protoplanetary discs they are important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to condense out of the protostellar nebula Particle capture also occurs at distances relevant to planet formation
We have obtained the first continuous disk averaged spectrum of Mars from 450 to 1550 Ghz using the Herschel-SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer The spectrum was obtained at a constant resolution of 1 4 GHz across the whole band The flux from the planet is such that the instrument was operated in &#34;bright source&#34; mode to prevent saturation of the detectors
This was the first successful use of this mode and in this work we describe the method used for observing Mars together with a detailed discussion of the data reduction techniques required to calibrate the spectrum We discuss the calibration accuracy obtained and describe the first comparison with surface and atmospheric models
In addition to a direct photometric measurement of the planet the spectrum contains the characteristic transitions of 12CO from J 5-4 to J 13-12 as well as numerous H2O transitions Together these allow the comparison to global atmospheric models allowing the mean mixing ratios of water and 12CO to be investigated
The flybys of Jupiter by the Voyager spacecraft in 1979 and over two decades later by Cassini in 2000 have provided us with unique datasets from two different epochs allowing the investigation of seasonal change in the atmosphere In this paper we model zonal averages of thermal infrared spectra from the two instruments
Voyager 1 IRIS and Cassini CIRS to retrieve the vertical and meridional profiles of temperature and the abundances of the two minor hydrocarbons acetylene (C2H2) and ethane (C2H6) The spatial variation of these gases is controlled by both chemistry and dynamics and therefore their observed distribution gives us an insight into both processes
We find that the two gases paint quite different pictures of seasonal change Whilst the 2-D cross-section of C2H6 abundance is slightly increased and more symmetric in 2000 (northern summer solstice) compared to 1979 (northern fall equinox) the major trend of equator to pole increase remains For C2H2 on the other hand
We study the dynamical stability of planetary systems consisting of one hypothetical terrestrial mass planet ($1 $ or $10 \mearth$) and one massive planet ($10 \mearth - 10 \mjup$) We consider masses and orbits that cover the range of observed planetary system architectures (including non-zero initial eccentricities) determine the stability limit through N-body simulations
and compare it to the analytic Hill stability boundary We show that for given masses and orbits of a two planet system a single parameter which can be calculated analytically describes the Lagrange stability boundary (no ejections or exchanges) but which diverges significantly from the Hill stability boundary However we do find that the actual boundary is fractal
and therefore we also identify a second parameter which demarcates the transition from stable to unstable evolution We show the portions of the habitable zones of $\rho$ CrB HD 164922 GJ 674 and HD 7924 which can support a terrestrial planet These analyses clarify the stability boundaries in exoplanetary systems and demonstrate that
Aims We determine the physical properties (spin state and shape) of asteroid (21) Lutetia target of the ESA Rosetta mission to help in preparing for observations during the flyby on 2010 July 10 by predicting the orientation of Lutetia as seen from Rosetta <br>Methods We use our novel KOALA inversion algorithm to determine the physical properties of asteroids from a combination of optical lightcurves
disk-resolved images and stellar occultations although the latter are not available for (21) Lutetia <br>Results We find the spin axis of (21) Lutetia to lie within 5 degrees of ({\lambda} = 52 deg {\beta} = -6 deg ) in Ecliptic J2000 reference frame (equatorial {\alpha} = 52 deg {\delta} = +12 deg
) and determine an improved sidereal period of 8 168 270 \pm 0 000 001 h This pole solution implies the southern hemisphere of Lutetia will be in &#34;seasonal&#34; shadow at the time of the flyby The apparent cross-section of Lutetia is triangular as seen &#34;pole-on&#34; and more rectangular as seen &#34;equator-on&#34;
Interplanetary dust (IPD) scatters solar radiation which results in the zodiacal light that dominates the celestial diffuse brightness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths Both asteroid collisions and cometary ejections produce the IPD but the relative contribution from these two sources is still unknown The Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) onboard the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (CIBER) observed the astrophysical sky spectrum between 750 and 2100 nm over a wide range of ecliptic latitude
The resulting zodiacal light spectrum is redder than the solar spectrum and shows a broad absorption feature previously unreported at approximately 900 nm suggesting the existence of silicates in the IPD material The spectral shape of the zodiacal light is isotropic at all ecliptic latitudes within the measurement error The zodiacal light spectrum
We report the discovery of HAT-P-15b a transiting extrasolar planet in the `period valley&#39; a relatively sparsely-populated period regime of the known extrasolar planets The host star GSC 2883-01687 is a G5 dwarf with V=12 16 It has a mass of 1 01+/-0 04 M(Sun) radius of 1 08+/-0 04 R(Sun)
effective temperature 5568+/-90 K and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0 22+/-0 08 The planetary companion orbits the star with a period 10 863502+/-0 000027 days transit epoch Tc = 2454638 56019+/-0 00048 (BJD) and transit duration 0 2285+/-0 0015 days It has a mass of 1 946+/-0 066 M(Jup) and radius of 1
At an age of 6 8+/-2 1 Gyr the planet is H/He-dominated and theoretical models require about 2% (10 M(Earth)) worth of heavy elements to reproduce its measured radius With an estimated equilibrium temperature of 820 K during transit and 1000 K at occultation HAT-P-15b is a potential candidate to study moderately cool planetary atmospheres by transmission and occultation spectroscopy
The streaming instability (SI) provides a promising mechanism for planetesimal formation because of its ability to concentrate solids into dense clumps The degree of clumping strongly depends on the height-integrated solid to gas mass ratio Z in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) In this letter we show that the magnitude of the radial pressure gradient (RPG) which drives the SI (characterized by $q\equiv{\eta}v_K/c_s$
where ${\eta}v_K$ is the reduction of Keplerian velocity due to the RPG and $c_s$ is the sound speed) also strongly affects clumping We present local two-dimensional hybrid numerical simulations of aerodynamically coupled particles and gas in the midplane of PPDs Magnetic fields and particle self-gravity are ignored We explore three different RPG values appropriate for typical PPDs
$q=0 025 0 05$ and 0 1 For each $q$ value we consider four different particle size distributions ranging from sub millimeter to meter sizes and run simulations with solid abundance from Z=0 01 up to Z=0 07 We find that a small RPG strongly promotes particle clumping in that
The ACS and NICMOS have been used to obtain new HST images of NGC 4038/4039 (&#34;The Antennae&#34;) These new observations allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars based on both size and color We use this ability to extend the cluster luminosity function by approximately two magnitudes over our previous WFPC2 results
and find that it continues as a single power law dN/dL propto L^alpha with alpha=-2 13+/-0 07 down to the observational limit of Mv~-7 Similarly the mass function is a single power law dN/dM propto M^beta with beta=-2 10+/-0 20 for clusters with ages t&lt;3x10^8 yr corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 Msun
depending on the age range of the subsample Hence the power law indices for the luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same The luminosity function for intermediate-age clusters (i e ~100-300 Myr old objects found in the loops tails and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to Mv~-6
consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict the turnover should not be observed until Mv~-4 An analysis of individual ~0 5-kpc sized areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values of alpha and beta similar to the results for the total population of clusters in the system Several of the areas studied show evidence for age gradients
with somewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of younger clusters The area around Knot B is a particularly interesting example with an ~10-50 Myr old cluster of estimated mass ~10^6 Msun having apparently triggered the formation of several younger more massive (up to 5x10^6 Msun) clusters along a dust lane
A Bayesian statistical analysis suggests that the probability of the companion hypothesis is comparable to or greater than the probability of the null hypothesis of a statistical fluke Such a companion could also have produced the detached Kuiper Belt object Sedna The putative companion could be easily detected by the recently launched Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
The recently discovered exoplanet Gl581d is extremely close to the outer edge of its system&#39;s habitable zone which has led to much speculation on its possible climate We have performed a range of simulations to assess whether given simple combinations of chemically stable greenhouse gases the planet could sustain liquid water on its surface
For best estimates of the surface gravity surface albedo and cloud coverage we find that less than 10 bars of CO2 is sufficient to maintain a global mean temperature above the melting point of water Furthermore even with the most conservative choices of these parameters we calculate temperatures above the water melting point for CO2 partial pressures greater than about 40 bar
We compare non-locality of interactions between different scales in hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a strongly magnetized medium We use 3-dimensional incompressible direct numerical simulations to evaluate non-locality of interactions Our results show that non-locality in MHD turbulence is much more pronounced than that in HD turbulence
Transit timing variations - deviations from strict periodicity between successive passages of a transiting planet - can be used to probe the structure and dynamics of multiple-planet systems In this paper we examine prospects for numerically solving the so-called inverse problem the determination of the orbital elements of a perturbing body from the transit timing variations it induces
We assume that the planetary systems under examination have a limited number of Doppler velocity measurements and show that a more extensive radial velocity characterization with precision comparable to the semiamplitude of the perturber may remove degeneracies in the solution We examine several configurations of interest including (1) a prototypical non-resonant system
modeled after HD40307 b and c which contains multiple super-Earth mass planets (2) a hypothetical system containing a transiting giant planet with a terrestrial-mass companion trapped in low-order mean motion resonance and (3) the HAT-P-13 system in which forced precession by an outer perturbing body that is well characterized by Doppler radial velocity measurements can give insight into the interior structure of a perturbing planet
We seek the best size estimates of the asteroid (21) Lutetia the direction of its spin axis and its bulk density assuming its shape is well described by a smooth featureless triaxial ellipsoid and to evaluate the deviations from this assumption Methods We derive these quantities from the outlines of the asteroid in 307 images of its resolved apparent disk obtained with adaptive optics (AO) at Keck II and VLT
and combine these with recent mass determinations to estimate a bulk density Our best triaxial ellipsoid diameters for Lutetia based on our AO images alone are a x b x c = 132 x 101 x 93 km with uncertainties of 4 x 3 x 13 km including estimated systematics
with a rotational pole within 5 deg of ECJ2000 [long lat] = [45 -7] or EQJ2000 [RA DEC] = [44 +9] The AO model fit itself has internal precisions of 1 x 1 x 8 km but it is evident both from this model derived from limited viewing aspects and the radius vector model given in a companion paper
that Lutetia has significant departures from an idealized ellipsoid In particular the long axis may be overestimated from the AO images alone by about 10 km Therefore we combine the best aspects of the radius vector and ellipsoid model into a hybrid ellipsoid model as our final result of 124 +/- 5 x 101 +/- 4 x 93 +/- 13 km that can be used to estimate volumes
sizes and projected areas The adopted pole position is within 5 deg of [long lat] = [52 -6] or[RA DEC] = [52 +12] Using two separately determined masses and the volume of our hybrid model we estimate a density of 3 5 +/- 1 1 or 4 3 +/- 0
(Abridged) We present local 2D and 3D hybrid numerical simulations of particles and gas in the midplane of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) using the Athena code The particles are coupled to gas aerodynamically with particle-to-gas feedback included Magnetorotational turbulence is ignored as an approximation for the dead zone of PPDs and we ignore particle self-gravity to study the precursor of planetesimal formation
Our simulations include a wide size distribution of particles ranging from strongly coupled particles with dimensionless stopping time tau_s=Omega t_stop=1e-4 to marginally coupled ones with tau_s=1 (where Omega is the orbital frequency t_stop is the particle friction time) and a wide range of solid abundances Our main results are 1
Particles with tau_s&gt;=0 01 actively participate in the streaming instability generate turbulence and maintain the height of the particle layer before Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is triggered 2 Strong particle clumping as a consequence of the streaming instability occurs when a substantial fraction of the solids are large (tau_s&gt;=0 01) and when height-integrated solid to gas mass ratio Z is super-solar
The radial drift velocity is reduced relative to the conventional Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi (NSH) model especially at high Z We derive a generalized NSH equilibrium solution for multiple particle species which fits our results very well 4 Collision velocity between particles with tau_s&gt;=0 01 is dominated by differential radial drift and is strongly reduced at larger Z
We have numerically integrated the orbits of ejecta from Telesto and Calypso the two small Trojan companions of Saturn&#39;s major satellite Tethys Ejecta were launched with speeds comparable to or exceeding their parent&#39;s escape velocity consistent with impacts into regolith surfaces We find that the fates of ejecta fall into several distinct categories
depending on both the speed and direction of launch <br>The slowest ejecta follow sub-orbital trajectories and re-impact their source moon in less than one day Slightly faster debris barely escape their parent&#39;s Hill sphere and are confined to tadpole orbits librating about Tethys&#39; triangular Lagrange points L4 (leading near Telesto) or L5 (trailing
near Calypso) with nearly the same orbital semi-major axis as Tethys Telesto and Calypso These ejecta too eventually re-impact their source moon but with a median lifetime of a few dozen years Those which re-impact within the first ten years or so have lifetimes near integer multiples of 348 6 days (half the tadpole period)
<br>Still faster debris with azimuthal velocity components &gt;~ 10 m/s enter horseshoe orbits which enclose both L4 and L5 as well as L3 but which avoid Tethys and its Hill sphere These ejecta impact either Telesto or Calypso at comparable rates with median lifetimes of several thousand years However they cannot reach Tethys itself; only the fastest ejecta
with azimuthal velocities &gt;~ 40 m/s achieve &#34;passing orbits&#34; which are able to encounter Tethys Tethys accretes most of these ejecta within several years but some 1 % of them are scattered either inward to hit Enceladus or outward to strike Dione over timescales on the order of a few hundred years
The gullies on Mars were discovered in the year <a href="http //1999 Since" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> then several hypotheses have appeared trying to explain the presence of these gullies The main hypotheses are the ones which suggest that some liquid water or CO2 was responsible for modeling the gullies and ones that propose dry flows as the modeling agents
The aim of this work is to develop an alternative hypotetical mechanism of formation of Martian <a href="http //gullies Our" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> model proposes that the Martian gullies were formed as a result of a fluidization process of the material deposited on the slopes of the impact craters
plateaux and other geomorphologic structures This fluidization is caused by the sublimation of carbon dioxide ice deposited in the form of snow due to the daily and seasonal temperature changes We also present the results of an experimental <a href="http //simulation Structures" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> similar to the Martian gullies were reproduced using the air injection mechanism
as a substitute to gaseous CO2 on a sandy slope The Reynolds number for our experimental flow and for the flow in the Martian gullies was calculated and we found that they are of the same order whilst the water flows have much higher Reynolds <a href="http //numbers Taking" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> into account the current environmental conditions for Mars
from our results it may be suggested that this mechanism is the possible modeling agent for the Martian gullies Two of the most important characteristics of the proposed model are a) It offers a simple explanation of how recurrent fluidization events occur in the same place a necessary recurrence of the formation of a gully
We study mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow in close-in exoplanetary systems The planet&#39;s atmospheric gas passes through the inner Lagrangian point and flows along a narrow stream accelerating to 100-$200\kms$ velocity before forming an accretion disk We show that the cylinder-shaped accretion stream can have an area (projected in the plane of the sky) comparable to that of the planet and a significant optical depth to spectral line absorption
Such a &#34;transiting cylinder&#34; may produce an earlier ingress of the planet transit as suggested by recent HST observations of the WASP-12 system The asymmetric disk produced by the accretion stream may also lead to time-dependent obscuration of the star light and apparent earlier ingress We also consider the interaction of the stellar wind with the planetary magnetosphere
Since the wind speed is subsonic/sub-Alfvenic and comparable to the orbital velocity of the planet the head of the magnetopause lies eastward relative to the substellar line (the line joining the planet and the star) The gas around the magnetopause may if sufficiently compressed give rise to asymmetric ingress/egress during the planet transit
Thermal emission from Kuiper Belt object (136108) Haumea was measured with Herschel-PACS at 100 and 160 micrometers for almost a full rotation period Observations clearly indicate a 100-micrometer thermal lightcurve with an amplitude of a factor of ~ 2 which is positively correlated with the optical lightcurve This confirms that both are primarily due to shape effects
A 160-micrometer lightcurve is marginally detected Radiometric fits of the mean Herschel- and Spitzer- fluxes indicate an equivalent diameter D ~ 1300 km and a geometric albedo p_v ~ 0 70-0 75 These values agree with inferences from the optical lightcurve supporting the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis The large amplitude of the 100-micrometer lightcurve suggests that the object has a high projected a/b axis ratio (~ 1
We report on the initial analysis of a Herschel/PACS full range spectrum of Neptune covering the 51-220 micrometer range with a mean resolving power of ~ 3000 and complemented by a dedicated observation of CH4 at 120 micrometers Numerous spectral features due to HD (R(0) and R(1)) H2O CH4 and CO are present
but so far no new species have been found Our results indicate that (i) Neptune&#39;s mean thermal profile is warmer by ~ 3 K than inferred from the Voyager radio-occultation; (ii) the D/H mixing ratio is (4 5+/-1) X 10**-5 confirming the enrichment of Neptune in deuterium over the protosolar value (~ 2
and CH4 appears to decrease in the lower stratosphere at a rate consistent with local saturation in agreement with the scenario of CH4 stratospheric injection from Neptune&#39;s warm south polar region; (iv) the H2O stratospheric column is (2 1+/-0 5) X 10**14 cm-2 but its vertical distribution is still to be determined
(Shortened) We have used the measured properties of the stars in the 79 exoplanetary systems with one or more planets that have been observed in transit to estimate each system&#39;s present habitability The measured stellar properties have been used to determine the present location of the classical habitable zone (HZ)
To establish habitability we use the estimated distances from the giant planet(s) within which an Earth-like planet would be inside the gravitational reach of the giant Of the 79 transiting systems known in April 2010 only 2 do not offer safe havens to Earth-like planets in the HZ and thus could not support life today
We have also estimated whether habitability is possible for 1 7 Gyr into the past i e 0 7 Gyr for a heavy bombardment plus 1 0 Gyr for life to emerge and thus be present today We find that for the best estimate of each stellar age an additional 28 systems do not offer such sustained habitability
If we reduce 1 7 Gyr to 1 0 Gyr this number falls to 22 However if giant planets orbiting closer to the star than the inner boundary of the HZ have got there by migration through the HZ and if this ruled out the subsequent formation of Earth-like planets
then of course none of the presently known transiting exoplanetary systems offers habitability Fortunately this bleak conclusion could well be wrong As well as obtaining results on the 79 transiting systems this paper demonstrates a method for determining the habitability of the cornucopia of such systems that will surely be discovered over the next few years
We present H and Ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipse of the hot Jupiter TrES-3b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of 0 133+/-0 017% in Ks-band (8-sigma) - a result in sharp contrast to the eclipse depth reported by de Mooij &amp; Snellen
We do not detect its thermal emission in H-band but place a 3-sigma limit on the depth of the secondary eclipse in this band of 0 051% A secondary eclipse of this depth in Ks requires very efficient day-to-nightside redistribution of heat and nearly isotropic reradiation conclusion that is in agreement with longer wavelength
mid-infrared Spitzer observations Our 3-sigma upper-limit on the depth of our H-band secondary eclipse also argues for very efficient redistribution of heat and suggests that the atmospheric layer probed by these observations may be well homogenized However our H-band upper limit is so constraining that it suggests the possibility of a temperature inversion at depth
or an absorbing molecule such as methane that further depresses the emitted flux at this wavelength The combination of our near-infrared measurements and those obtained with Spitzer suggest that TrES-3b displays a near isothermal dayside atmospheric temperature structure whose spectrum is well approximated by a blackbody We emphasize that our strict H-band limit is in stark disagreement with the best-fit atmospheric model that results from longer wavelength observations only
Since the 1970&#39;s when the Viking spacecrafts carried out experiments aimed to the detection of microbial metabolism on the surface of Mars the search for nonspecific methods to detect life in situ has been one of the goals of astrobiology It is usually required that the methodology can detect life independently from its composition or form
and that the chosen biological signature points to a feature common to all living systems as the presence of metabolism In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) for the detection of microbial life in situ MFCs are electrochemical devices originally developed as power electrical sources
and can be described as fuel cells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms These microorganisms as part of their metabolic process oxidize organic material releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current which is therefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes We show that power and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures or soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium free of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples
Observations of the water inventory as well as other chemically important species on Jupiter will be performed in the frame of the guaranteed time key project of the Herschel Space Observatory entitled &#34;Water and related chemistry in the Solar system&#34; Among other onboard instruments PACS (Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer) will provide new data of the spectral atlas in a wide region covering the far-infrared and submillimetre domains
with an improved spectral resolution and a higher sensitivity compared to previous observations carried out by Cassini/CIRS (Composite InfraRed Spectrometer) and by ISO (Infrared Space Observatory) In order to optimise the observational plan and to prepare for the data analysis we have simulated the expected spectra of PACS Jupiter observations
Our simulation shows that PACS will promisingly detect several H2O emission lines As PACS is capable of spatially resolving the Jovian disk we will be able to discern the external oxygen sources in the giant planets by exploring the horizontal distribution of water In addition to H2O lines some absorption lines due to tropospheric CH4
We show that the outside equation of a bounded elliptically symmetric lens (ESL) exhibits a pseudo-caustic that arises from a branch cut A pseudo-caustic is a curve in the source plane across which the number of images changes by one The inside lens equation of a bounded ESL is free of a pseudo-caustic
Thus the total parity of the images of a point source lensed by a bounded elliptically symmetric mass is not an invariant in violation of the Burke&#39;s theorem A smooth mass density function does not guarantee the validity of the Burke&#39;s theorem <br>Pseudo-caustics of various lens equations are discussed In the Appendix
Bourassa and Kantowski&#39;s deflection angle formula for an elliptically symmetric lens is reproduced using the Schwarz function of the ellipse for an easy access; the outside and inside lens equations of an arbitrary set of truncated circularly or elliptically symmetric lenses represented as points sticks and disks are presented as a reasonable approximation of the realistic galaxy or cluster lenses
<br>One may consider smooth density functions that are not bounded but fall sufficiently fast asymptotically to preserve the total parity invariance Any bounded function may be sufficiently closely approximated by an unbounded smooth function obtained by truncating its Fourier integral at a high frequency mode Whether to use a bounded function or an unbounded smooth function for an ESL lens mass density
whereby whether to observe the total parity invariance or not incurs philosophical questions For example is it sensible to insist that the elliptical symmetry of an elliptic lens galaxy be valid in the entire sky? How a pseudo-caustic close to or intersecting with a caustic must be withered away during a smoothing process and what it means will be investigated in a separate work
Photometric follow-ups of transiting exoplanets may lead to discoveries of additional less massive bodies in extrasolar systems This is possible by detecting and then analysing variations in transit timing of transiting exoplanets We present photometric observations gathered in 2009 and 2010 for exoplanet WASP-3b during the dedicated transit-timing-variation campaign The observed transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a periodic variation in the observations minus calculations diagram
Simplified models assuming the existence of a perturbing planet in the system and reproducing the observed variations of timing residuals were identified by three-body simulations We found that the configuration with the hypothetical second planet of the mass of about 15 Earth masses located close to the outer 2 1 mean motion resonance is the most likely scenario reproducing observed transit timing
We investigate the long-term and large-scale viscous evolution of dense planetary rings using a simple 1D numerical code We use a physically realistic viscosity model derived from N-body simulations (Daisaka et al 2001) and dependent on the disk&#39;s local properties (surface mass density particle size distance to the planet) Particularly
we include the effects of gravitational instabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk&#39;s viscosity We show that common estimates of the disk&#39;s spreading time-scales with constant viscosity significantly underestimate the rings&#39; lifetime With a realistic viscosity model an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary stages (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating
with the formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally gravitationally stable and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2 (where M_0 is the disk&#39;s initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the spreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become not-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density
until the disk becomes completely not-self-gravitating At this point its evolution dramatically slows down with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0 which significantly increases the disk&#39;s lifetime compared to the case with constant viscosity We show also that the disk&#39;s width scales like t^{1/4} with the realistic viscosity model while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of constant viscosity
resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our model We find however that the present shape of Saturn&#39;s rings looks like a 100 million-years old disk in our simulations Concerning Jupiter&#39;s Uranus&#39; and Neptune&#39;s rings that are faint today it is not likely that they were much more massive in the past and lost most of their mass due to viscous spreading alone
We refine the physical parameters of the transiting hot Jupiter planet XO-1b and its stellar host XO-1 using HST NICMOS observations XO-1b has a radius Rp=1 21+/-0 03 RJup and XO-1 has a radius Rs=0 94+/-0 02 RSun where the uncertainty in the mass of XO-1 dominates the uncertainty of Rp and Rs
There are no significant differences in the XO-1 system properties between these broad-band NIR observations and previous determinations based upon ground-based optical observations We measure two transit timings from these observations with 9 s and 15 s precision As a residual to a linear ephemeris model there is a 2
These two transit timings and additional timings from the literature are sufficient to rule out the presence of an Earth mass planet orbiting in 2 1 mean motion resonance coplanar with XO-1b We identify and correct for poorly understood gain-like variations present in NICMOS time series data This correction reduces the effective noise in time series photometry by a factor of two
We report the discovery of WASP-8 a transiting planet of 2 25+-0 08 M_Jup on a strongly inclined eccentric 8 15-day orbit moving in a retrograde direction to the rotation of its late-G host star Evidence is found that the star is in a multiple stellar system with two other companions
We show that stars with transiting planets for which the stellar obliquity is large are preferentially hot (T_eff &gt; 6250 K) This could explain why small obliquities were observed in the earliest measurements which focused on relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys as opposed to hotter stars that emerged later from transit surveys
The observed trend could be due to differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass Alternatively we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin with a wide range of obliquities but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to tidal dissipation in their convective zones while hot stars cannot realign because of their thinner convective zones
I derive the physical properties of 30 transiting extrasolar planetary systems using a homogeneous analysis of published data The light curves are modelled with the JKTEBOP code with attention paid to limb darkening and eccentricity The light from some systems is contaminated by faint nearby stars which if ignored will systematically bias the results
I show that this must be accounted for using external measurements of the amount of contaminating light A contamination of 5% is enough to make the measurement of a planetary radius 2% too low The physical properties of the 30 transiting systems are obtained by interpolating in stellar model predictions to find the best match to their measured quantities
The error budgets are used to compile a list of systems which would benefit from additional observations The systematic errors arising from the inclusion of stellar models are assessed by using five different theoretical models This model dependence sets a lower limit on the accuracy of measurements of the system properties
and at worst is 1% for the stellar mass The correlations of planetary surface gravity and mass with orbital period have significance levels of only 3 1 sigma and 2 3 sigma The division of planets into two classes based on Safronov number is increasingly blurred Most of the objects studied here would benefit from more photometry and/or spectroscopy
Direct imaging and characterization of extrasolar Earth-like planets is strongly impacted by the orbital inclination of the planet to be studied as a combination of pure geometrical effects and the impact of exozodiacal dust Here we perform simulations to quantify the impact of a priori knowledge of inclination for the efficiency of a typical coronagraphic or occulter-based mission
The relative impact and complementarity with prior knowledge of exozodiacal brightness down to achievable levels is examined and discussed It is found that inclination has an even greater impact than the exozodiacal brightness though the two have excellent complementarity We also discuss different methods for inclination determination and their respective applicability to the context of precursor science to an imaging mission
Spectrally blue (B-type) asteroids are rare with the second discovered asteroid Pallas being the largest and most famous example We conducted a focused infrared spectroscopic survey of B-type asteroids to search for water-related features in these objects Our results show that the negative optical spectral slope of some B-type asteroids is due to the presence of a broad absorption band centered near 1
The 1-micron band can be matched in position and shape using magnetite (Fe3O4) which is an important indicator of past aqueous alteration in the parent body Furthermore our observations of B-type asteroid (335) Roberta in the 3-micron region reveal an absorption feature centered at 2 9 micron which is consistent with the absorption due to phyllosilicates (another hydration product) observed in CI chondrites
The two major factors contributing to the opposition brightening of Saturn&#39;s rings are i) the intrinsic brightening of particles due to coherent backscattering and/or shadow-hiding on their surfaces and ii) the reduced interparticle shadowing We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for different elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions
We assume that the intrinsic contribution is independent of B so that any B dependence of the phase curves is due to interparticle shadowing which must also act similarly for all colors We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models to fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening Eliminating the modeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the opposition effect
for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent backscattering; for the C ring an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may also be present <br>Based on our simulations the width of the interparticle shadowing effect is roughly proportional to B This follows from the observation that as B decreases
the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor upper ring layers whereas at larger $B$&#39;s the dense inner parts are visible The elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of the B ring tilt effect (the increase of brightness with elevation) From comparison of the magnitude of the tilt effect at different filters
we show that multiple scattering can account for at most a 10% brightness increase as B -&gt; 26^o whereas the remaining 20% brightening is due to a variable degree of interparticle shadowing The negative tilt effect of the middle A ring is well explained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the observed A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry
We report on an initial analysis of Herschel/HIFI observations of hydrogen chloride (HCl) hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) and molecular oxygen (O_2) in the Martian atmosphere performed on 13 and 16 April 2010 (L_s ~ 77°) We derived a constant volume mixing ratio of 1400 +/- 120 ppm for O_2 and determined upper limits of 200 ppt for HCl and 2 ppb for H_2O_2
A large fraction of 100-km-class low-inclination objects in the classical Kuiper Belt (KB) are binaries with comparable mass and wide separation of components A favored model for their formation was capture during the coagulation growth of bodies in the early KB Instead recent studies suggested that large objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of locally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity
Here we examine the possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the excess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a solitary object We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward the formation of KB binaries with observed properties and can explain wide systems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36
Notably the gravitational collapse is capable of producing 100% binary fraction for a wide range of the swarm&#39;s initial angular momentum values The binary components have similar masses (80% have the secondary-over-primary radius ratio &gt;0 7) and their separation ranges from ~1 000 to ~100 000 km The binary orbits have eccentricities from e=0 to ~1
with the majority having e&lt;0 6 The binary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the swarm range from i=0 to ~90 deg with most cases having i&lt;50 deg Our binary formation mechanism implies that the primary and secondary components in each binary pair should have identical bulk composition
We investigated the impact of three different modifications of Newtonian gravity on motions of Keplerian objects within the Solar System These objects are located at distances of the order of the distance to the Oort cloud With these three modifications we took into account a heliocentric Dark-Matter halo as was indicated by Diemand et al
Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and a vacuum-induced force due to a locally negative cosmological constant $\Lambda_-$ derived by Fahr &amp; Siewert In gravitationally bound systems it turns out that all three modifications deliver the same qualitative results Initially circular orbits for the pure Newtonian case are forced to convert into ellipses with perihelion migrations
This paper concerns kinematic helical dynamos in a spherical fluid body surrounded by an insulator In particular we examine their behaviour in the regime of large magnetic Reynolds number $\Rm$ for which dynamo action is usually concentrated upon a simple resonant stream-surface The dynamo eigensolutions are computed numerically for two representative single-roll flows using a compact spherical harmonic decomposition and fourth-order finite-differences in radius
Many small moonlets creating propeller structures have been found in Saturn&#39;s rings by the Cassini spacecraft We study the dynamical evolution of such 20-50m sized bodies which are embedded in Saturn&#39;s rings We estimate the importance of various interaction processes with the ring particles on the moonlet&#39;s eccentricity and semi-major axis analytically
For low ring surface densities the main effects on the evolution of the eccentricity and the semi-major axis are found to be due to collisions and the gravitational interaction with particles in the vicinity of the moonlet For large surface densities the gravitational interaction with self-gravitating wakes becomes important <br>We also perform realistic three dimensional
collisional N-body simulations with up to a quarter of a million particles A new set of pseudo shear periodic boundary conditions is used which reduces the computational costs by an order of magnitude compared to previous studies Our analytic estimates are confirmed to within a factor of two <br>On short timescales the evolution is always dominated by stochastic effects caused by collisions and gravitational interaction with self-gravitating ring particles
These result in a random walk of the moonlet&#39;s semi-major axis The eccentricity of the moonlet quickly reaches an equilibrium value due to collisional damping The average change in semi-major axis of the moonlet after 100 orbital periods is 10-100m This translates to an offset in the azimuthal direction of several hundred kilometres
The core accretion mechanism is presently the most widely accepted cause of the formation of giant planets For simplicity most models presently assume that the growth of planetary embryos occurs in isolation We explore how the simultaneous growth of two embryos at the present locations of Jupiter and Saturn affects the outcome of planetary formation
We model planet formation on the basis of the core accretion scenario and include several key physical ingredients We consider a protoplanetary gas disk that exponentially decays with time For planetesimals we allow for a distribution of sizes from 100~m to 100~km with most of the mass in the smaller objects
We include planetesimal migration as well as different profiles for the surface density $\Sigma$ of the disk The core growth is computed in the framework of the oligarchic growth regime and includes the viscous enhancement of the planetesimal capture cross-section Planet migration is ignored By comparing calculations assuming formation of embryos in isolation to calculations with simultaneous embryo growth
we find that the growth of one embryo generally significantly affects the other This occurs in spite of the feeding zones of each planet never overlapping The results may be classified as a function of the gas surface density profile $\Sigma$ if $\Sigma \propto r^{-3/2}$ and the protoplanetary disk is rather massive
Jupiter&#39;s formation inhibits the growth of Saturn If $\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$ isolated and simultaneous formation lead to very similar outcomes; in the the case of $\Sigma \propto r^{-1/2}$ Saturn grows faster and induces a density wave that later acclerates the formation of Jupiter Our results indicate that the simultaneous growth of several embryos impacts the final outcome and should be taken into account by planet formation models
We develop atmosphere models of two of the three Kepler-field planets that were known prior to the start of the Kepler mission (HAT-P-7b and TrES-2) We find that published Kepler and Spitzer data for HAT-P-7b appear to require an extremely hot upper atmosphere on the dayside with a strong thermal inversion and little day-night redistribution
The Spitzer data for TrES-2 suggest a mild thermal inversion with moderate day-night redistribution We examine the effect of nonequilibrium chemistry on TrES-2 model atmospheres and find that methane levels must be adjusted by extreme amounts in order to cause even mild changes in atmospheric structure and emergent spectra Our best-fit models to the Spitzer data for TrES-2 lead us to predict a low secondary eclipse planet-star flux ratio (~2 x 10^-5) in the Kepler bandpass
which is consistent with what very recent observations have found Finally we consider how the Kepler-band optical flux from a hot exoplanet depends on the strength of a possible extra optical absorber in the upper atmosphere We find that the optical flux is not monotonic in optical opacity and the non-monotonicity is greater for brighter
A numerical model of the Yarkovsky-O&#39;Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect for objects defined in terms of a triangular mesh is described The algorithm requires that each surface triangle can be handled independently which implies the use of a 1D thermal model Insolation of each triangle is determined by an optimized ray-triangle intersection search
Surface temperature is modeled with a spectral approach; imposing a quasi-periodic solution we replace heat conduction equation by the Helmholtz equation Nonlinear boundary conditions are handled by an iterative FFT based solver The results resolve the question of the YORP effect in rotation rate independence on conductivity within the nonlinear 1D thermal model regardless of the accuracy issues and homogeneity assumptions
Variation in high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) has been proposed to explain a 62 My periodicity in terrestrial fossil biodiversity It has been suggested that the infall of our galaxy toward the Virgo cluster could generate an extragalactic shock accelerating charged particles and exposing the earth to a flux of high energy cosmic rays (HECRs)
The oscillation of the Sun perpendicular to the galactic plane could induce 62 My periodicity in the HECR flux on the Earth with a magnitude much higher than the Galactic cosmic ray change we see in a solar cycle This mechanism could potentially explain the observed 62 My periodicity in terrestrial biodiversity over the past 500 My
In addition to direct effects on life from secondaries HECRs induced air showers ionize the atmosphere leading to changes in atmospheric chemistry and microphysical processes that can lead to cloud formation including low altitude cloud cover An increase in ionization changes the global electric circuit which could enhance the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) through microphysical processes such as electroscavenging and ion mediated nucleation
leading to an increase in the cloud cover This could increase the albedo and reduce the solar flux reaching the ground reducing the global temperature Using an existing model we have calculated the enhancement in atmospheric ionization at low altitudes resulting from exposure to HECRs We use a conservative model to estimate the change in low altitude cloud cover from this increased ionization
Current disruption (CD) and the related kinetic instabilities in the near-Earth magnetosphere represent physical mechanisms which can trigger multi-scale substorm activity including global reorganizations of the magnetosphere Lui et al (2008) proposed a CD scenario in which the kinetic scale linear modes grow and reach the typical dipolarization scales through an inverse cascade
The experimental verification of the inverse nonlinear cascade is based on wavelet analysis In this paper the Hilbert-Huang transform is used which is suitable for nonlinear systems and allows to reconstruct the time-frequency representation of empirical decomposed modes in an adaptive manner It was found that in the Lui et al
All extra-solar planet masses that have been derived spectroscopically are lower limits since the inclination of the orbit to our line-of-sight is unknown except for transiting systems It is however possible to determine the inclination angle i between the rotation axis of a star and an observer&#39;s line-of-sight from measurements of the projected equatorial velocity (v sin i)
the stellar rotation period (P_rot) and the stellar radius (R_star) This allows the removal of the sin i dependency of spectroscopically derived extra-solar planet masses under the assumption that the planetary orbits lie perpendicular to the stellar rotation axis We have carried out an extensive literature search and present a catalogue of v sin i
P_rot and R_star estimates for exoplanet host stars In addition we have used Hipparcos parallaxes and the Barnes-Evans relationship to further supplement the R_star estimates obtained from the literature Using this catalogue we have obtained sin i estimates using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis This allows proper 1-sigma two-tailed confidence limits to be placed on the derived sin i&#39;s along with the transit probability for each planet to be determined
While a small proportion of systems yield sin i&#39;s significantly greater than 1 most likely due to poor P_rot estimations the large majority are acceptable We are further encouraged by the cases where we have data on transiting systems as the technique indicates inclinations of ~90 degrees and high transit probabilities
In total we estimate the true masses of 133 extra-solar planets Of these only 6 have revised masses that place them above the 13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit Our work reveals a population of high-mass planets with low eccentricities and we speculate that these may represent the signature of different planetary formation mechanisms at work
Radial velocity and transit surveys indicate that solar-type stars bear super-Earths with mass and period up to ~ 20 M_E and a few months are more common than those with Jupiter-mass gas giants In many cases these super-Earths are members of multiple-planet systems in which their mutual dynamical interaction has influenced their formation and evolution
In this paper we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take into account protoplanetary embryos&#39; interaction with their evolving natal gaseous disk as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with each other We show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emerge interior to the ice line
grow migrate and congregate into closely-packed convoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars After the disk-gas depletion they undergo orbit crossing close scattering and giant impacts to form multiple rocky Earths or super-Earths in non-resonant orbits around ~ 0 1AU with moderate eccentricities of ~0 01-0 1
We investigate the formation process of planetesimals from the dust layer by the gravitational instability in the gas disk using local $N$-body simulations The gas is modeled as a background laminar flow We study the formation process of planetesimals and its dependence on the strength of the gas drag Our simulation results show that the formation process is divided into three stages qualitatively
the formation of wake-like density structures the creation of planetesimal seeds and their collisional growth The linear analysis of the dissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularly unstable although Toomre&#39;s $Q$ value is larger than unity However in the initial stage the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer than that of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion
We describe a method of determining the V magnitude of an asteroid using differential photometry with the magnitudes of comparison stars derived from Carlsberg Meridian Catalogue 14 (CMC14) data The availability of a large number of suitable CMC14 stars enables a reasonably accurate magnitude (\pm0 05 mag) to be found without having to resort to more complicated absolute or all-sky photometry
(Abridged) A numerical model of a circumstellar debris disk is developed and applied to observations of the circumstellar dust orbiting beta Pictoris The model accounts for the rates at which dust is produced by collisions among unseen planetesimals and the rate at which dust grains are destroyed due to collisions
The model also accounts for the effects of radiation pressure which is the dominant perturbation on the disk&#39;s smaller but abundant dust grains Solving the resulting system of rate equations then provides the dust abundances versus grain size and over time Those solutions also provide the dust grains&#39; collisional lifetime versus grain size
and the debris disk&#39;s optical depth and surface brightness versus distance from the star Comparison to observations then yields estimates of the unseen planetesimal disk&#39;s radius and the rate at which the disk sheds mass due to planetesimal grinding <br>The model is then applied to optical observations of the edge-on dust disk orbiting beta Pictoris
and good agreement is achieved when the unseen planetesimal disk is broad with 75&lt;r&lt;150 AU If it is assumed that the dust grains are bright like Saturn&#39;s icy rings then the cross section of dust in the disk is A_d~2x10^20 km^2 and its mass is M_d~11 lunar masses In this case the planetesimal disk&#39;s dust production rate is quite heavy
dM_d/dt~9 earth-masses per Myr implying that there is or was a substantial amount of planetesimal mass there at least 110 earth-masses But if the dust grains are darker than assumed then the planetesimal disk&#39;s mass-loss rate and its total mass are heavier In fact the apparent dearth of any major planets in this region
The Lyot project used an optimized Lyot coronagraph with Extreme Adaptive Optics at the 3 63m Advanced Electro-Optical System telescope (AEOS) to observe 86 stars from 2004 to 2007 In this paper we give an overview of the survey results and a statistical analysis of the observed nondetections around 58 of our targets to place constraints on the population of substellar companions to nearby stars
The observations did not detect any companion in the substellar regime Since null results can be as important as detections we analyzed each observation to determine the characteristics of the companions that can be ruled out For this purpose we use a Monte Carlo approach to produce artificial companions and determine their detectability by comparison with the sensitivity curve for each star
All the non-detection results are combined using a Bayesian approach and we provide upper limits on the population of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs for this sample of stars Our nondetections confirm the rarity of brown dwarfs around solar-like stars and we constrain the frequency of massive substellar companions (M&gt;40Mjup) at orbital separation between and 10 and 50 AU to be &lt;20%
Orbital variation in reflected starlight from exoplanets could eventually be used to detect surface oceans Exoplanets with rough surfaces or dominated by atmospheric Rayleigh scattering should reach peak brightness in full phase orbital longitude = 180 deg whereas ocean planets with transparent atmospheres should reach peak brightness in crescent phase near OL = 30 deg
Application of Fresnel theory to a planet with no atmosphere covered by a calm ocean predicts a peak polarization fraction of 1 at OL = 74 deg; however our model shows that clouds wind-driven waves aerosols absorption and Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere and within the water column dilute the polarization fraction and shift the peak to other OLs
Observing at longer wavelengths reduces the obfuscation of the water polarization signature by Rayleigh scattering but does not mitigate the other effects Planets with thick Rayleigh scattering atmospheres reach peak polarization near OL = 90 deg but clouds and Lambertian surface scattering dilute and shift this peak to smaller OL
A shifted Rayleigh peak might be mistaken for a water signature unless data from multiple wavelength bands are available Our calculations suggest that polarization alone may not positively identify the presence of an ocean under an Earth-like atmosphere; however polarization adds another dimension which can be used in combination with unpolarized orbital light curves and contrast ratios
We have begun the ExploreNEOs project in which we observe some 700 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) at 3 6 and 4 5 microns with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its Warm Spitzer mode From these measurements and catalog optical photometry we derive albedos and diameters of the observed targets The overall goal of our ExploreNEOs program is to study the history of near-Earth space by deriving the physical properties of a large number of NEOs
In this paper we describe both the scientific and technical construction of our ExploreNEOs program We present our observational photometric and thermal modeling techniques We present results from the first 101 targets observed in this program We find that the distribution of albedos in this first sample is quite broad
probably indicating a wide range of compositions within the NEO population Many objects smaller than one kilometer have high albedos (&gt;0 35) but few objects larger than one kilometer have high albedos This result is consistent with the idea that these larger objects are collisionally older and therefore possess surfaces that are more space weathered and therefore darker
The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat
The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far
I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington&#39;s approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities
respectively The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels
This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point In these conditions present-day models yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458b
An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction sufficiently to explain its size However the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations or in the case of non-radiative vertical transport of energy
We present results from a suite of N-body simulations that follow the accretion history of the terrestrial planets using a new parallel treecode that we have developed We initially place 2000 equal size planetesimals between 0 5--4 0 AU and the collisional growth is followed until the completion of planetary accretion (&gt; 100 Myr)
All the important effect of gas in laminar disks are taken into account the aerodynamic gas drag the disk-planet interaction including Type I migration and the global disk potential which causes inward migration of secular resonances as the gas dissipates We vary the initial total mass and spatial distribution of the planetesimals
the time scale of dissipation of nebular gas and orbits of Jupiter and Saturn We end up with one to five planets in the terrestrial region In order to maintain sufficient mass in this region in the presence of Type I migration the time scale of gas dissipation needs to be 1-2 Myr
The final configurations and collisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter If today&#39;s eccentricity of Jupiter is used then most of bodies in the asteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to the inward migration of the secular resonance and giant impacts between protoplanets occur most commonly around 10 Myr
If the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter is close to zero as suggested in the Nice model the effect of the secular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a long period of time in the asteroidal region With a circular orbit for Jupiter giant impacts usually occur around 100 Myr
We report the first extrasolar planet observations from the 10 4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) currently the world&#39;s largest fully steerable single-aperture optical telescope We used the OSIRIS tunable filter imager on the GTC to acquire high-precision narrow-band photometry of the transits of the giant exoplanets TrES-2b and TrES-3b We obtained near-simultaneous observations in two near-infrared (NIR) wavebands (790
Our results demonstrate a very-high photometric precision with minimal atmospheric contamination despite relatively poor atmospheric conditions and some technical problems with the telescope We find the photometric precision for the TrES-2 observations to be 0 343 and 0 412 mmag for the 790 2 and 794 4 nm light curves
and the precision of the TrES-3 observations was found to be 0 470 and 0 424 mmag for the 790 2 and 794 4 nm light curves We also discuss how future follow-up observations of transiting planets with this novel technique can contribute to the characterization of Neptune- and super-Earth-size planets to be discovered by space-based missions like CoRoT and Kepler
[ABRIDGED] Since the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planet transit timing has been recognized as a powerful method to discover and characterize additional planets in these systems However the gravitational influence of additional planets is not the only expected source of transit timing variations In this work we derive the expected detection frequency of stellar companions of hot-jupiter transiting planets host-stars
detectable by means of transit timing analysis Since roughly half of the stars in the solar neighborhood belong to binary or multiple stellar systems the same fraction of binary systems may be expected to be present among transiting planet-host stars unless planet formation is significantly influenced by the presence of a stellar companion
Transit searches are less affected by the selection biases against long-period binaries that plague radial velocity surveys If the frequency of binaries among hot-jupiter planets host stars is the same as determined in the solar neighborhood after 5 years since the discovery of a sample of transiting planets 1 0%+/-0
and 2 8%+/-0 3% after 10 years if the planetary and binary orbits are coplanar Considering the case of random inclinations the probabilities are 0 6%+/-0 1% and 1 7%+/-0 2% after 5 and 10 years respectively Our estimates can be considered conservative lower limits since we have taken into account only binaries with periods P&gt;5x10^3 days (a&gt;=6 AU)
Several lines of evidence suggest that fine silicate crystals observed in primitive meteorite and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) nucleated in a supersaturated silicate vapor followed by crystalline growth We investigated evaporation of $\mu$m-sized silicate particles heated by a bow shock produced by a planetesimal orbiting in the gas in the early solar nebula and condensation of crystalline silicate from the vapor thus produced
Our numerical simulation of shock-wave heating showed that these {\mu}m-sized particles evaporated almost completely when the bow shock is strong enough to cause melting of chondrule precursor dust particles We found that the silicate vapor cools very rapidly with expansion into the ambient unshocked nebular region; the cooling rate is estimated
for instance to be as high as 2000 K s$^{-1}$ for a vapor heated by a bow shock associated with a planetesimal of radius 1 km The rapid cooling of the vapor leads to nonequilibrium gas-phase condensation of dust at temperatures much lower than those expected from the equilibrium condensation
It was found that the condensation temperatures are lower by a few hundred K or more than the equilibrium temperatures This explains the results of the recent experimental studies of condensation from a silicate vapor that condensation in such large supercooling reproduces morphologies similar to those of silicate crystals found in meteorites
Accretion is a fundamental process in star formation Although the time evolution of accretion remains a matter of debate observations and modelling studies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the formation of the protostar Observing young stellar objects during these elevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady accretion
ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded Herbig Be star undergoing photometric outbursts and a FU Orionis star The Herbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst detected so far We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying the emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line
a powerful tracer of accretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars Using the AMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000 we performed spatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas emitting across the Brackett gamma emission line during and after the outburst From the visibilities and differential phases
we derive characteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric measurements across the line with respect to the continuum We find that the line profile the astrometric signal and the visibilities are inconsistent with the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter They are instead evidence of a bipolar wind
maybe partly seen through a disk hole inside the dust sublimation radius The disappearance of the Brackett gamma emission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a period of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the line of sight Based on these conclusions
We present the results of a site characterization study carried out at the Astronomical Observatory of the Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley (OAVdA) in the Western Italian Alps aimed at establishing its potential to host a photometric transit search for small-size planets around a statistically significant sample of nearby cool M dwarfs
[abridged] we gauged site-dependent observing conditions such as night-sky brightness photometric precision and seeing properties Public meteorological data were also used in order to help in the determination of the actual number of useful observing nights per year The measured zenithal $V$-band night-sky brightness is typical of that of very good
very dark observing sites The extinction registered at $V$ band is not dissimilar from that of other sites The median seeing over the period of in situ observations is found to be $\sim1 7^{\prime\prime}$ Given the limited duration of the observations we did not probe any possible seeing seasonal patterns
or the details of its possible dependence on other meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction Moreover our data show that the seeing at the observatory was reasonably stable during most of the nights The fraction of fully clear nights per year amounts to 39\% while the total of useful nights increases to 57\% assuming a (conservative) cloud cover of not more than 50\% of the night
Based on the analysis of photometric data collected over the period May-August 2009 for three stellar fields centered on the transiting planet hosts WASP-3 HAT-P-7 and Gliese 436 we achieve seeing-independent best-case photometric precision $\sigma_\mathrm{ph}\lesssim3$ mmag (rms) in several nights for bright stars ($R\lesssim 11$ mag) A median performance $\sigma_\mathrm{ph}\sim6$ mmag during the observing period is obtained for stars with $R\lesssim13$ mag
The planet formation process and subsequent planet migration may lead to configurations resulting in strong dynamical interactions among the various planets Well-studied possible outcomes include collisions between planets scattering events that eject one or more of the planets and a collision of one or more of the planets with the parent star
In this work we consider one other possibility that has seemingly been overlooked in the various scattering calculations presented in the literature the tidal capture of two planets which leads to the formation of a binary planet (or binary brown dwarf) in orbit about the parent star We carry out extensive numerical simulations of such dynamical and tidal interactions to explore the parameter space for the formation of such binary planets
We show that tidal formation of binary planets is possible for typical planet masses and distances from the host star The detection (or lack thereof) of planet-planet binaries can thus be used to constrain the properties of planetary systems including their mutual spacing during formation and the fraction of close planets in very eccentric orbits which are believed to form by a closely related process
A photometric method is described for accurately quantifying the brightness of short-period comets far from perihelion The method utilizes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Catalog (Data Release 7) as a homogeneous source of reference star magnitudes Results are based on SDSS-r&#39; filtered images taken using 2 0-m aperture telescopes for which the exposure time was adjusted to achieve a constant motion-blur of 2
Aperture photometry using circular and tilted elliptical apertures was performed on images which were stacked to increase signal to noise Magnitude dependence on &#39;seeing&#39; was determined and this calibration was used to normalize photometry to constant seeing thereby maximizing photometric accuracy From observations of comet 17P/Holmes between 2008 October and 2009 March
a very significant outburst of 17P was found to have occurred on 2009 Jan 4 7 (\pm0 5 day) Night-to-night measurements of the brightness of the inner coma (3000-km radius) exhibited a scatter of only 0 015-0 019 mag No short time-scale (&lt;36 hr) periodicity was found in the fading lightcurve
From literature data it was estimated that reflected light from the nucleus contributed 7-11% of the signal within the inner coma and it is concluded that either the nucleus of 17P must be relatively spherical (projected axial ratio of &lt;1 25) or if its shape is more typical of other comet nuclei
A few years ago the mid-IR spectrum of a Weak Line T Tauri Star CoKu Tau/4 was explained as emission from the inner wall of a circumstellar disk with the inner disk truncated at ~10 AU Based on the SED shape and the assumption that it was produced by a single star and its disk
CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a prototypical transitional disk with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by a planet some other orbiting body or by photodissociation However recently it has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system This implies that the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk
The aim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the inner wall of a circumbinary disk with parameters constrained by what is known about the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between these stars and their surrounding disk
In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED the binary orbit should be almost circular implying a small mid-IR variability (10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the circumbinary disk Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is located at 1
where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU) A small amount of optically thin dust in the hole (&lt;0 01 lunar masses) helps to improve the fit to the 10microns silicate band Also we find that water ice should be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio &lt;5
We report on the initial analysis of Herschel/HIFI carbon monoxide (CO) observations of the Martian atmosphere performed between 11 and 16 April 2010 We selected the (7-6) rotational transitions of the isotopes ^{13}CO at 771 GHz and C^{18}O at 768 GHz in order to retrieve the mean vertical profile of temperature and the mean volume mixing ratio of carbon monoxide
The derived temperature profile agrees within less than 5 K with general circulation model (GCM) predictions up to an altitude of 45 km however show about 12-15 K lower values at 60 km The CO mixing ratio was determined as 980 \pm 150 ppm in agreement with the 900 ppm derived from Herschel/SPIRE observations in November 2009
We present 230 realizations of a numerical model of planet formation in systems without gas giants These represent a scenario in which protoplanets grow in a region of a circumstellar disk where water ice condenses (the &#34;ice line&#39;&#39;) but fail to accrete massive gas envelopes before the gaseous disk is dispersed
Each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationally interacting oligarchs and a much larger number of small bodies that represent the natal disk of planetesimals We investigate systems with varying initial number of oligarchs oligarch spacing location of the ice line total mass in the ice line and oligarch mean density
Systems become chaotic in ~1 Myr but settle into stable configurations in 10-100 Myr We find (1) runs consistently produce a 5-9 Earth mass planet at a semimajor axis of 0 25-0 6 times the position of the ice line (2) the distribution of planets&#39; orbital eccentricities is distinct from
and skewed toward lower values than the observed distribution of (giant) exoplanet orbits (3) inner systems of two dominant planets (e g Earth and Venus) are not stable or do not form because of the gravitational influence of the innermost icy planet The planets predicted by our model are unlikely to be detected by current Doppler observations
Microlensing is currently sensitive to the most massive planets found in our simulations A scenario where up to 60% of stars host systems such as those we simulate is consistent with all the available data We predict that if this scenario holds the NASA Kepler spacecraft will detect about 120 planets by two or more transits over the course of its 3
Very little is known about magnetic fields of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs We use the energy flux scaling law presented by Christensen et al (2009) to calculate the evolution of average magnetic fields in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs under the assumption of fast rotation which is probably the case for most of them
We find that massive brown dwarfs of about 70 M_Jup can have fields of a few kilo-Gauss during the first few hundred Million years These fields can grow by a factor of two before they weaken after deuterium burning has stopped Brown dwarfs with weak deuterium burning and extrasolar giant planets start with magnetic fields between ~100G and ~1kG at the age of a few Myr
depending on their mass Their magnetic field weakens steadily until after 10Gyr it has shrunk by about a factor of 10 We use observed X-ray luminosities to estimate the age of the known extrasolar giant planets that are more massive than 0 3M_Jup and closer than 20pc Taking into account the age estimate
and assuming sun-like wind-properties and radio emission processes similar to those at Jupiter we calculate their radio flux and its frequency The highest radio flux we predict comes out as 700mJy at a frequency around 150MHz for $\tau$Boob but the flux is below 60mJy for the rest Most planets are expected to emit radiation between a few Mhz and up to 100MHz
Radial velocity (RV) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value of M_T sin(i) condition (ie give information about) not only the planet&#39;s true mass M_T but also the value of sin(i) for that system (where i is the orbital inclination angle) Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution
i e the presumptive prior distribution Rather the posterior distribution from which it is drawn depends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being studied We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several &#34;toy models&#34; for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M_T
The results show that the effect can be an important one For example even for simple power-law distributions of M_T the median value of sin(i) in an observed RV sample can vary between 0 860 and 0 023 (as compared to the 0 866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of the power-law in the range between -2 and +1
respectively Over the same range of indicies the 95% confidence interval on M_T varies from 1 002-4 566 (alpha = -2) to 1 13-94 34 (alpha = +1) times larger than M_T sin(i) due to sin(i) uncertainty alone Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets both individual objects and statistical samples
should regard the sin(i) factor as more than a &#34;numerical constant of order unity&#34; with simple and well understood statistical properties We argue that reports of M_T sin(i) determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding confidence bounds on M_T at say the 95% level based on an explicitly stated assumed form of the true M_T distribution in order to more accurately reflect the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies
In this last Paper III additional evidences that the solar high energetic particles radiation with energies higher as 100 MeV (the solar cosmic rays SCR) is an very important component for the &#34;Sun- climate&#34; relationship are given (see also Paper I and II) The total solar irradiance (TSI) and the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) variations given an integral climate effect of cooling in sunspot minima and warming in the sunspot maxima
Unlike the both ones the powerful solar corpuscular events plays a cooling climate role during the epochs of their heigh levels By this one subcenturial global and regional temperature quasi- cyclic changes by duration of approximately 60 years could be track during the last 150 years of instrumental climate observations
It has been also evided in the paper that this subcenturial oscilation is very important in the Group sunspot number (GSN) data series since the Maunder minimum up to the end of 20th century Thus the solar erruptive activity effect make the total &#34;Sun -climate&#34; relationship essentially more complicated as it could be follow when only the TSI and GCR variations are taken into account
In this light the climate warming tendency after AD 1975 is rather by a natural as by an antropogenic origin Most probably the last one is very close related to the general downward tendency of erruptive solar events which is superimposed over the high long term TSI levels during the last three decades (AD 1975-2007)
It is evided that the efficiency of the solar corpuscular activuty over the climate is strongly depended by the &#34;north-south&#34; asymmetry of the solar activity centers (as a proxy the sunspots area north-south asymmetry index A is used there) The climate cooling effect in the Northern hemisphere is most powerful during the epochs of positive values of A
Samples returned from comet 81P/Wild 2 by Stardust confirm that substantial quantities of crystalline silicates were incorporated into the comet at formation We investigate the constraints that this observation places upon protoplanetary disk physics assuming that outward transport of particles processed at high temperatures occurs via advection and turbulent diffusion in an evolving disk
We also look for constraints on particle formation locations Our results are based upon 1D disk models that evolve with time under the action of viscosity and photoevaporation and track solid transport using an ensemble of individual particle trajectories We find that two classes of disk model are consistent with the Stardust findings
One class features a high particle diffusivity (a Schmidt number Sc &lt; 1) which suffices to diffuse particles up to 20 microns in size outward against the mean gas flow For Sc &gt; 1 such models are unlikely to be viable and significant outward transport requires that the particles of interest settle into a midplane layer that experiences an outward gas flow
In either class of models the mass of inner disk material that reaches the outer disk is a strong function of the disk&#39;s initial compactness Hence models of grain transport within steady-state disks underestimate the efficiency of outward transport Neither model results in sustained outward transport of very large particles exceeding a mm in size
We show that the transport efficiency generally falls off rapidly with time Hence high-temperature material must be rapidly incorporated into icy bodies to avoid fallback and significant radial transport may only occur during the initial phase of rapid disk evolution It may also vary substantially between disks depending upon their initial mass distributions
We present a short review of the impact regime experienced by the terrestrial planets within our own Solar system describing the three populations of potentially hazardous objects which move on orbits that take them through the inner Solar system Of these populations the origins of two (the Near-Earth Asteroids and the Long-Period Comets) are well understood
with members originating in the Asteroid belt and Oort cloud respectively By contrast the source of the third population the Short-Period Comets is still under debate The proximate source of these objects is the Centaurs a population of dynamically unstable objects that pass perihelion between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune
However a variety of different origins have been suggested for the Centaur population Here we present evidence that at least a significant fraction of the Centaur population can be sourced from the planetary Trojan clouds stable reservoirs of objects moving in 1 1 mean-motion resonance with the giant planets (primarily Jupiter and Neptune)
Focusing on simulations of the Neptunian Trojan population we show that an ongoing flux of objects should be leaving that region to move on orbits within the Centaur population With conservative estimates of the flux from the Neptunian Trojan clouds we show that their contribution to that population could be of order ~3%
while more realistic estimates suggest that the Neptune Trojans could even be the main source of fresh Centaurs We suggest that further observational work is needed to constrain the contribution made by the Neptune Trojans to the ongoing flux of material to the inner Solar system and believe that future studies of the habitability of exoplanetary systems should take care not to neglect the contribution of resonant objects (such as planetary Trojans) to the impact flux that could be experienced by potentially habitable worlds
The model accepted is one where during the Archean Eon the Earths climate was clement despite the weaker Sun The observational evidence that supports this concept is the emergence of life the existence of evaporitic sediments and the presence of terrigenous sediments all of which require liquid water and clement conditions
A theoretical argument used to support this idea is the so called ice-albedo feedback which states that if the Earth was frozen it would still be <a href="http //frozen The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> aim of this document is to present an alternative scenario in which a frozen world
&#34;snowball&#34; style with liquid water at the bottom of the sea also allows for the emergence of life and evaporitic and terrigenous sedimentation Archean climatic evidence available at present is discussed and can be reinterpreted to support the idea that in Archean times the surface of the Earth was frozen
Also a mathematical model is being developed to demonstrate that the ice-albedo feedback is not an inevitable consequence of a frozen Archean Eon Results Reinterpretation of the evidence shows that life could appear within the oceanic depths and not necessarily on the surface The evaporitic sediments could have formed by saline saturation of the water enclosed in the limited cavities of liquid water located at the bottom of the ocean
Also the terrigenous sediments could have been formed by catastrophic currents of liquid water due to the fusion of the ice from the sub glacial volcanoes From the mathematical model it is deduced that the defrosting moment of the Earth is towards the end of the Proterozoic moment in which the evidence shows the &#34;snowball&#34; Earth ends
The disk around AB Aur was imaged and resolved at 24 6\ $\mu$m using the Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer on the 8 2m Subaru Telescope The gaussian full-width at half-maximum of the source size is estimated to be 90 $\pm$ 6 AU indicating that the disk extends further out at 24
$\mu$m than at shorter wavelengths In order to interpret the extended 24 6\ $\mu$m image we consider a disk with a reduced surface density within a boundary radius $R_c$ which is motivated by radio observations that suggest a reduced inner region within about 100 AU from the star Introducing the surface density reduction factor $f_c$ for the inner disk
we determine that the best match with the observed radial intensity profile at 24 6\ $\mu$m is achieved with $R_c$=88 AU and $f_c$=0 01 We suggest that the extended emission at 24 6\ $\mu$m is due to the enhanced emission from a wall-like structure at the boundary radius (the inner edge of the outer disk)
which is caused by a jump in the surface density at $R_c$ Such reduced inner disk and geometrically thick outer disk structure can also explain the more point-like nature at shorter wavelengths We also note that this disk geometry is qualitatively similar to a pre-transitional disk suggesting that the AB Aur disk is in a pre-transitional disk phase
We report the discovery by the CoRoT satellite of a new transiting giant planet in a 2 83 days orbit about a V=15 5 solar analog star (M_* = 1 08 +- 0 08 M_sun R_* = 1 1 +- 0 1 R_sun T_eff = 5675 +- 80 K) This new planet
Planetary bodies form by accretion of smaller bodies It has been suggested that a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of size &lt;&lt;km (e g chondrules boulders or fragments of larger bodies) as they can be kept dynamically cold We investigate the effects of gas drag on the impact radii and the accretion rates of these particles
As simplifying assumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings a gas drag law linear in velocity and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure gradient that causes particles to drift in radially These approximations however enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space The framework of the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically integrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters
Three accretion modes can be distinguished hyperbolic encounters where the 2-body gravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters where gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters where particles settle towards the protoplanet An analysis of the observed behavior is presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact radius
which confirms the numerical findings We apply our results to the sweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU Accretion of debris on small protoplanets (&lt;50 km) is found to be slow because the fragments are distributed over a rather thick layer However the newly found settling mechanism
We study the impactor flux and cratering on Pluto and Charon due to the collisional evolution of Plutinos Plutinos are those trans-Neptunian objects located at 39 5 AU in the 3 2 mean motion resonance with Neptune To do this we develop a statistical code that includes catastrophic collisions and cratering events
and takes into account the stability and instability zones of the 3 2 mean motion resonance with Neptune We proposes different initial populations that account for the uncertainty in the size distribution of Plutinos at small sizes Depending on the initial population our results indicate the following The number of D &gt; 1 km Plutinos streaking Pluto over 3
For Charon the number of D &gt; 1 km Plutino impactors is between 354 and 1545 The number of D &gt; 1 km craters on Pluto produced by Plutinos during the last 3 5 Gyr is between 43076 and 113879 For Charon the number of D &gt; 1 km craters is between 20351 and <a href="http
//50688 The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> largest Plutino impactor onto Pluto has a diameter between 17 and 23 km which produces a craterwith a diameter of 31 - 39 km The largest Plutino impactor onto Charon has a diameter between 10 and 15 km which produces a crater with a diameter of 24 - 33 km
We test if 2 Pluto-sized objects are assumed in the 3 2 Neptune resonance then the total number of Plutino impactors both onto Pluto as Charon with diameters D &gt; 1 km is a factor of 1 6 - 1 8 larger if considering 1 Pluto-sized object Given the dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian region
it is necessary to study in detail the contribution of all the potential sources of impactors on the Pluto-Charon system to obtain the main contributor and the whole production of craters Then we will be able to contrast those studies with observations which will help us to understand the geological processes and history of the surface of those worlds
Hundred meter sized objects have been identified by the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn&#39;s A ring through the so-called &#34;propeller&#34; features they create in the ring These moonlets should migrate due to their gravitational interaction with the ring ; in fact some orbital variation have been detected The standard theory of type I migration of planets in protoplanetary disks can&#39;t be applied to the ring system
as it is pressureless Thus we compute the differential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of solid particles with flat surface density profile both analytically and numerically We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to explain the observed variations of the propeller&#39;s orbit in Saturn&#39;s A-ring
<br>However local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally gravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet Our simulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the observations depending on the parameters of the rings We find that on time scales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated by stochastic effects (while the former
non-stochastic migration dominates after ~ 10^{4-5} years) In that case the migration rates provided by observations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be of the order of 700 kg/m^2 The age of the propellers shouldn&#39;t exceed 1 to 100 million years depending on the dominant migration regime
We show that the fate of moons of a close-in giant planet is mainly determined by the migration history of the planet in the protoplanetary disk As the planet migrates in the disk from beyond the snow line towards a multi-day period orbit the formed and forming moons become unstable as the planet&#39;s sphere of influence shrinks
Disk-driven migration is faster than the moons&#39; tidal orbital evolution Moons are eventually ejected from around close-in exoplanets or forced into collision with them before tides from the star affect their orbits If moons are detected around close-in exoplanets they are unlikely to have been formed in situ instead they were captured from the protoplanetary disk on retrograde orbits around the planets
Since its first discovery most extrasolar planets were detected using radial velocity (RV) method However the RV method does not provide all parameters required to characterize a planetary system Recently Charbonneau et al (2000) and Brown et al(2001)have shown that the RV planet orbiting HD 209458 can be observed using transit method yielding some additional information
We continue our previous work on the potential short-term influence of a gamma ray bursts on Earth&#39;s biosphere focusing on the only important short-term effect on life the ultraviolet flash which occurs as a result of the retransmission of the {\gamma} radiation through the atmosphere Thus in this work we calculate the ultraviolet irradiances penetrating the first hundred meters of the water column
Since1984 asteroid study is conducted at Department of Astronomy Bandung Institute of Technology At present there are two main streams in our research dynamical and physical study Astronomers determine the orbital elements of more than 12000 asteroids and the number is increasing In the distribution of orbital elements of asteroids
there are several features such as Kirkwood gap groups and families To know the dynamical evolution of asteroids it is very important to study these features Recently some small bodies of our solar system have been approached to the Earth one of them was Toutatis These objects are interested to study
Most of the known transiting exoplanets are in short-period orbits largely due to the bias inherent in detecting planets through the transit technique However the eccentricity distribution of the known radial velocity planets results in many of those planets having a non-negligible transit probability One such case is the massive planet orbiting the giant star iota Draconis
a situation where both the orientation of the planet&#39;s eccentric orbit and the size of the host star inflate the transit probability to a much higher value than for a typical hot Jupiter Here we present a revised fit of the radial velocity data with new measurements and a photometric analysis of the stellar variability
We hypothesise that planets are made by tidal downsizing of migrating giant planet embryos The proposed scheme for planet formation consists of these steps (i) a massive young protoplanetary disc fragments at R ~ several tens to hundreds of AU on gaseous clumps with masses of a few Jupiter masses; (ii) the clumps cool and contract
and simultaneously migrate closer in to the parent star; (iii) as earlier suggested by Boss (1998) dust sediments inside the gas clumps to form terrestrial mass solid cores; (iv) if the solid core becomes more massive than ~ 10 Earth masses a massive gas atmosphere collapses onto the solid core; (v) when the gas clumps reach the inner few AU from the star
tidal shear and evaporation due to stellar irradiation peel off the outer metal-poor envelope of the clump If tidal disruption occurs quickly while the system is still in stage (iii) a terrestrial planet core is left If it happens later in stage (iv) a metal rich gas giant planet with a solid core emerges from the envelope
We discuss a mechanism for cosmic ray penetration into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope particularly the effect of the finite Larmor radius and magnetic field irregularities First we derive analytical solutions for cosmic ray behavior inside a magnetic flux rope on the basis of the Newton-Lorentz equation of a particle
to investigate how cosmic rays penetrate magnetic flux ropes under an assumption of there being no scattering by small-scale magnetic field irregularities Next we perform a numerical simulation of a cosmic ray penetration into an interplanetary magnetic flux rope by adding small-scale magnetic field irregularities This simulation shows that a cosmic ray density distribution is greatly different from that deduced from a guiding center approximation because of the effect of the finite Larmor radius and magnetic field irregularities for the case of a moderate to large Larmor radius compared to the flux rope radius
(abridged) Angular momentum transport and accretion in protoplanetary discs are generally believed to be driven by MHD turbulence via the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) The dynamics of solid bodies embedded in such discs (dust grains boulders planetesimals and planets) may be strongly affected by the turbulence such that the formation pathways for planetary systems are determined in part by the strength and spatial distribution of the turbulent flow
<br>We examine the dynamics of planetesimals with radii between 1m â 10 km embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs using three dimensional MHD simulations The planetesimals experience gas drag and stochastic gravitational forces due to the turbulent disc We use and compare the results from local shearing box simulations and global models in this study
<br>The main aims of this work are to examine the growth and possible saturation of the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals as a function of their size and disc parameters; the rate of radial migration and diffusion of planetesimals; the conditions under which the results from shearing box and global simulations agree
<br>We find good agreement between local and global simulations when shearing boxes of dimension 4H x 16H x 2H are used (H being the local scale height) The magnitude of the density fluctuations obtained is sensitive to the box size due to the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves
This affects the stochastic forcing experienced by planetesimals [ ] <br>Our models show that fully developed MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs would have a destructive effect on embedded planetesimals Relatively low levels of turbulence are required for traditional models of planetesimal accretion to operate this being consistent with the existence of a dead zone in protoplanetary discs
We report the detection of a giant planet in a 6 4950 day orbit around the 1 7 Msun subgiant HD102956 The planet has a semimajor axis a = 0 081 AU and minimum mass Msini = 0 96 Mjup HD102956 is the most massive star known to harbor a hot Jupiter
and its planet is only the third known to orbit within 0 6 AU of a star more massive than 1 5 Msun Based on our sample of 137 subgiants with M* &gt; 1 45 Msun we find that 0 5-2 3% of A-type stars harbor a close-in planet (a &lt; 0
We report the detection of 24 micron variations from the planet-hosting upsilon Andromedae system consistent with the orbital periodicity of the system&#39;s innermost planet upsilon And b We find a peak-to-valley phase curve amplitude of 0 00130 times the mean system flux Using a simple model with two hemispheres of constant surface brightness and assuming a planetary radius of 1
We further report the largest phase offset yet observed for an extrasolar planet the flux maximum occurs ~80 degrees before phase 0 5 Such a large phase offset is difficult to reconcile with most current atmospheric circulation models We improve on earlier observations of this system in several important ways
(1) observations of a flux calibrator star demonstrate the MIPS detector is stable to 10^-4 on long timescales (2) we note that the background light varies systematically due to spacecraft operations precluding use of this background as a flux calibrator (stellar flux measured above the background is not similarly affected)
We present axisymmetric numerical calculations of the fluid flow induced in a spherical shell with inner sphere rotating and outer sphere stationary A magnetic field is also imposed consisting of particular linear combinations of axial and dipolar fields chosen to make $B_r=0$ at either the outer sphere or the inner
or in between This leads to the formation of Shercliff shear layers at these particular locations We then consider the effect of increasingly large inertial effects and show that an outer Shercliff layer is eventually de-stabilized an inner Shercliff layer appears to remain stable and an in-between Shercliff layer is almost completely disrupted even before the onset of time-dependence
Using orbital integration and analytical arguments we have found a new mechanism (an &#34;eccentricity trap&#34;) to halt type I migration of planets near the inner edge of a protoplanetary disk Because asymmetric eccentricity damping due to disk-planet interaction on the innermost planet at the disk edge plays a crucial role in the trap
this mechanism requires continuous eccentricity excitation and hence works for a resonantly interacting convoy of planets This trap is so strong that the edge torque exerted on the innermost planet can completely halt type I migrations of many outer planets through mutual resonant perturbations Consequently the convoy stays outside the disk edge
as a whole We have derived semi-analytical formula for the condition for the eccentricity trap and predict how many planets are likely to be trapped We found that several planets or more should be trapped by this mechanism in protoplanetary disks that have cavities It can be responsible for the formation of non-resonant
In a previous paper we have presented a global view of the stability of Neptune Trojan (NT hereafter) on inclined orbit We discuss in this paper the dependence of stability of NT orbits on the eccentricity High-resolution dynamical maps are constructed using the results of extensive numerical integrations of orbits initialized on the fine grids of initial semimajor axis (a0) versus eccentricity (e0)
The extensions of regions of stable orbits on the (a0 e0) plane at different inclinations are shown The maximum eccentricities of stable orbits in three most stable regions at low (0 12deg ) medium (22 36deg ) and high (51 59deg ) inclination are found to be 0 10 0
respectively The fine structures in the dynamical maps are described Via the frequency analysis method the mechanisms that portray the dynamical maps are revealed The secondary resonances concerning the frequency of the librating resonant angle and the frequency of the quasi 2 1 mean motion resonance between Neptune and Uranus
are found deeply involved in the motion of NTs Secular resonances are detected and they also contribute significantly to the triggering of chaos in the motion Particularly the effects of the secular resonance v8 v18 are clarified <br>We also investigate the orbital stabilities of six observed NTs by checking the orbits of hundreds clones of them generated within the observing error bars
We conclude that four of them except 2001 QR322 and 2005 TO74 are deeply inside the stable region The 2001 QR322 is in the close vicinity of the most significant secondary resonance The 2005 TO74 locates close to the boundary separating stable orbits from unstable ones and it may be influenced by a secular resonance
We have conducted an intensive search for any material that may orbit Rhea using images obtained by the Cassini ISS narrow-angle camera We find no evidence for any such material contradicting an earlier and surprising inference that Rhea the second-largest moon of Saturn possesses a system of narrow rings embedded in a broad circum-satellite disk or cloud (Jones et al
Science) If one accepts the calculations of the previous authors our results would require any narrow rings around Rhea to be composed of objects no smaller than 10 meters in radius in order to be massive enough to account for the observed charged-particle absorptions but diffuse enough to evade detection in our images
Such a particle-size distribution is unrealistic given that erosion processes will break down 10-meter objects to smaller sizes which would then have been seen in our images Furthermore Jones et al (2008) assumed that the absorption of electrons by hypothetical circum-Rhea particles is proportional to the volume of the particles
even when they are much larger than the electron penetration depth (van Allen 1983 1987 JGR) If we assume instead that large particles can only absorb electrons efficiently near their surfaces then our results rule out any solid material orbiting Rhea as the explanation for the absorptions detected by Jones et al
We explore numerically the flow induced in a spherical shell by differentially rotating the inner and outer spheres The fluid is also taken to be electrically conducting (in the low magnetic Reynolds number limit) and a magnetic field is imposed parallel to the axis of rotation If the outer sphere is stationary
the magnetic field induces a Shercliffe layer on the tangent cylinder the cylinder just touching the inner sphere and parallel to the field If the magnetic field is absent but a strong overall rotation is present Coriolis effects induce a Stewartson layer on the tangent cylinder The non-axisymmetric instabilities of both types of layer separately have been studied before; here we consider the two cases side by side
as well as the mixed case and investigate how magnetic and rotational effects interact We find that if the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the same direction the overall rotation may have a destabilizing influence whereas if the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the opposite direction
We announce the discovery of the transiting planet CoRoT-13b Ground based follow-up in CFHT and IAC80 confirmed CoRoT&#39;s observations The mass of the planet was measured with the HARPS spectrograph and the properties of the host star were obtained analyzing HIRES spectra from the Keck telescope It is a hot Jupiter-like planet with an orbital period of 4
and a density of 2 34 g cm-3 It orbits a G0V star with Teff=5945K M*=1 09 Msun R*=1 01 Rsun solar metallicity a lithium content of +1 45 dex and an estimated age between 0 12 and 3 15 Gyr The lithium abundance of the star is consistent with its effective temperature
We present six new transits of the hot Jupiter OGLE-TR-113b observed with MagIC on the Magellan Telescopes between January 2007 and May 2009 We update the system parameters and revise the planetary radius to R_p=1 084 pm 0 029 R_J where the error is dominated by stellar radius uncertainties The new transit midtimes reveal no transit timing variations from a constant ephemeris of greater than 13 pm 28 seconds over two years
placing an upper limit of 1-2 M_Earth on the mass of any perturber in a 1 2 or 2 1 mean-motion resonance with OGLE-TR-113b Combining the new transit epochs with five epochs published between 2002 and 2006 we find hints that the orbital period of the planet may not be constant
with the best fit indicating a decrease of dP/dt=-60 pm 15 milliseconds per year If real this change in period could result from either a long-period (more than 8 years) timing variation due to a massive external perturber or more intriguingly from the orbital decay of the planet The detection of a changing period is still tentative and requires additional observations
We report here the discovery of an new near-equal mass Trans-Neptunian Binaries (TNBs) L5c02 and the and the putative detection of a second TNB (L4k12) among the year two and three detections of the Canada-France-Eclipic Plane Survey (CFEPS) These new binaries (internal designation L4k12 and L5c02) have moderate separations of 0
The follow-up observation confirmed the binarity of L5c02 but L4k12 are still lack of more followup observations L4k12 has a heliocentric orbital inclination of ~ 35?degree marking this system as having the highest heliocentric orbital inclination among known near-equal mass binaries Both systems are members of the classical main Kuiper belt population
Based on the sample of objects searched we determine that the fraction of near-equal mass wide binaries with separations &gt; 0 4&#34; is 1 5% to 20% in the cold main classical Kuiper belt and if our detection the binarity L4k12 holds 3% to 43% in the hot main classical objects are binary
Although the rotation of some Saturn&#39;s satellites in spin-orbit has already been studied by several authors this is not the case of the rotation of Phoebe which has the particularity of being non resonant The purpose of the paper is to determine for the first time and with precision its precession-nutation motion
We adopt an Hamiltonian formalism of the motion of rotation of rigid celestial body set up by Kinoshita (1977) based on Andoyer variables and canonical equations First we calculate Phoebe&#39;s obliquity at J2000 0 from available astronomical data as well as the gravitational perturbation due to Saturn on Phoebe rotational motion
Then we carry out a numerical integration and we compare our results for the precession rate and the nutation coefficients with pure analytical model Our results for Phoebe obliquity (23°95) and Phoebe precession rate (5580&#34; 65/cy) are very close to the respective values for the Earth Moreover the amplitudes of the nutations (26&#34; peak to peak for the nutaton in longitude and 8&#34; for the nutation in obliquity) are of the same order as the respective amplitudes for the Earth
We give complete tables of nutation obtained from a FFT analysis starting from the numerical signals We show that a pure analytical model of the nutation is not accurate due to the fact that Phoebe orbital elements e M and Ls are far from having a simple linear behaviour The precession and nutation of Phoebe have been calculated for the first time in this paper

High-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar-system ephemeris in order to convert times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses measured at an observatory to the solar system barycenter Any error in the conversion to the barycentric TOAs leads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variation having a period and phase associated with the planet&#39;s orbital motion about the Sun
By using an array of pulsars (PSRs J0437-4715 J1744-1134 J1857+0943 J1909-3744) the masses of the planetary systems from Mercury to Saturn have been determined These masses are consistent with the best-known masses determined by spacecraft observations with the mass of the Jovian system 9 547921(2)E-4 Msun being significantly more accurate than the mass determined from the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft
and consistent with but less accurate than the value from the Galileo spacecraft While spacecraft are likely to produce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies the pulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potential to provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets
CoRoT-7 is an 11th magnitude K-star whose light curve shows transits with depth of 0 3 mmag and a period of 0 854 d superimposed on variability at the 1% level due to the modulation of evolving active regions with the star&#39;s 23 d rotation period In this paper we revisit the published HARPS radial velocity measurements of the object
which were previously used to estimate the companion mass but have been the subject of ongoing debate <br>We build a realistic model of the star&#39;s activity during the HARPS observations by fitting simultaneously the line width and the line bisector and use it to evaluate the contribution of activity to the RV variations
The data show clear evidence of errors above the level of the formal uncertainties which are accounted for either by activity nor by any plausible planet model and which increase rapidly with decreasing signal-to-noise of the spectra We cite evidence of similar systematics in mid-SNR spectra of other targets obtained with HARPS and other high-precision RV spectrographs
and discuss possible sources Allowing for these we re-evaluate the semi-amplitude of the CoRoT-7b signal finding Kb=1 6 +-1 3 m/s a tentative detection with a much reduced significance (1 2-sigma) compared to previous estimates We also argue that the combined presence of activity and additional errors preclude a meaningful search for additional low-mass companions
despite previous claims to the contrary <br>Our analysis points to a lower density for CoRoT-7b the 1-sigma mass range spanning 1-4 MEarth allowing for a wide range of bulk compositions In particular an ice-rich composition is compatible with the RV constraints This study highlights the importance of a realistic treatment of both activity and uncertainties
An unexpected feature of Titan&#39;s atmosphere is the strong depletion in primordial noble gases revealed by the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer aboard the Huygens probe during its descent on 2005 January 14 Although several plausible explanations have already been formulated no definitive response to this issue has been yet found
Here we investigate the possible sequestration of these noble gases in the liquid contained in lakes and wet terrains on Titan and the consequences for their atmospheric abundances Considering the atmosphere and the liquid existing on the soil as a whole system we compute the abundance of each noble gas relative to nitrogen
To do so we make the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium between the liquid and the atmosphere the abundances of the different constituents being determined via {\bf } regular solution theory We find that xenon&#39;s atmospheric depletion can be explained by its dissolution at ambient temperature in the liquid presumably present on Titan&#39;s soil
In support of the EPOXI mission we have compiled the secular light curve (SLC) of comet 103P/Hartley 2 the next target of EPOXI a) Of the order of 30 photometric parameters are measured over 20 of them new The turn on point of activity is -4 2 +/- 0 1 AU from the Sun
which corresponds to -400 +/- 40 d before perihelion The total active time is TACTIVE= 1484 +/- 43 d b) 103P is a young dwarf comet young because it has a photometric age P-AGE(1 1) = 15 +/- 2 cy (comet years) and dwarf because its diameter is DEFFE = 1
c) The nucleus is very active and the amplitude of the SLC is ASEC= 10 8 +/- 0 1 mag in 1997 This comet is as active as 1P/Halley but much smaller d) After remaining active up to aphelion the comet spills-over its activity into the next orbit e) Two linear laws change slope at a break point located at RBP = -1
and magnitude mBP = 9 4 +/- 0 1 Sublimation is not controlled by water ice The controlling substance may be CO or CO2 ice CO2 has been detected spectroscopically f) The water budget of this comet is calculated The comet expends 1 88 10^10 kg of water per apparition
A new water-budget age is defined and it is found that WB-AGE = 19 cy vs WB-AGE = 0 65 cy for 1P/Halley and 28 cy for 9P g) The values of Af{\rho} are calculated on two dates and we find dust production rates of 106 and 37 kg/s h) The thickness of the layer lost per apparition is calculated
and we find {\Delta}r = 39 m where r is the radius Since the radius of this comet is r = 570 m it is found that at the present rate the comet may disappear in only 17 revolutions (~109 y) i) All comets visited by spacecraft are young objects
We present Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) optical transit narrow-band photometry of the hot-Jupiter exoplanet XO-2b using the OSIRIS instrument This unique instrument has the capabilities to deliver high cadence narrow-band photometric lightcurves allowing us to probe the atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters from the ground The observations were taken during three transit events which cover four wavelengths at spectral resolutions near 500
necessary for observing atmospheric features and have near-photon limited sub-mmag precisions Precision narrow-band photometry on a large aperture telescope allows for atmospheric transmission spectral features to be observed for exoplanets around much fainter stars than those of the well studied targets HD209458b and HD189733b providing access to the majority of known transiting planets
For XO-2b we measure planet-to-star radius contrasts of R_pl/R_star=0 10508+/-0 00052 at 6792 Ang 0 10640+/-0 00058 at 7582 Ang and 0 10686+/-0 00060 at 7664 9 Ang and 0 10362+/-0 00051 at 8839 Ang These measurements reveal significant spectral features at two wavelengths with an absorption level of 0
and an absorption level of 0 058+/-0 016% at 7582 Ang (a 3 6-sigma significance level) When comparing our measurements to hot-Jupiter atmospheric models we find good agreement with models which are dominated in the optical by alkali metals This is the first evidence for potassium in an extrasolar planet
We investigate the possibility that the Moon develops an electric potential originating from the impinging particles on the Moon from cosmic rays and solar wind The investigation includes all experimental data of the flux of charged particle for energies higher than 865 eV available from Apollo missions satellites and balloon experiments in publications or from the Internet in 2008
A fictive electric potential of the Moon was calculated if the Moon material is an isolator for the Moon solar side and lee side if the Moon material is a conductor for the whole Moon surface and if the Moon is located in the geomagnetic tail of the Earth The calculation for these four cases results in positive electric potentials of the Moon of 1789 V
and 96 MV This is originated from the unequal distribution of positive and negative charges in the plasma of the cosmic rays and solar wind impinging on the Moon As the cosmic rays arrive from deep space these findings would imply a charge imbalance in the cosmos This is in distinct conflict with a charge neutral universe
Tidal effects arise from differential and inelastic deformation of a planet by a perturbing body The continuous action of tides modify the rotation of the planet together with its orbit until an equilibrium situation is reached It is often believed that synchronous motion is the most probable outcome of the tidal evolution process
since synchronous rotation is observed for the majority of the satellites in the Solar System However in the 19th century Schiaparelli also assumed synchronous motion for the rotations of Mercury and Venus and was later shown to be wrong Rather for planets in eccentric orbits synchronous rotation is very unlikely
The rotation period and axial tilt of exoplanets is still unknown but a large number of planets have been detected close to the parent star and should have evolved to a final equilibrium situation Therefore based on the Solar System well studied cases we can make some predictions for exoplanets
Here we describe in detail the main tidal effects that modify the secular evolution of the spin and the orbit of a planet We then apply our knowledge acquired from Solar System situations to exoplanet cases In particular we will focus on two classes of planets &#34;Hot-Jupiters&#34; (fluid) and &#34;Super-Earths&#34; (rocky with atmosphere)
We investigate gravitational lensing effects of an extrasolar planet transiting its host star We focus on the `rising spikes&#39; of the light curve just before and after the transit which is a peculiar feature of the gravitational lensing and find that it could be a novel observable for determining physical parameters
We show that by changing a single non-dimensional number the thermal Rossby number global atmospheric simulations with only axisymmetric forcing pass from an Earth-like atmosphere to a superrotating atmosphere that more resembles the atmospheres of Venus or Titan The transition to superrotation occurs under conditions in which equatorward-propagating Rossby waves generated by baroclinic instability at intermediate and high latitudes are suppressed
which will occur when the deformation radius exceeds the planetary radius At large thermal Rossby numbers following an initial nearly axisymmetric phase a global baroclinic wave of zonal wavenumber one generated by mixed barotropic-baroclinic instability dominates the eddy flux of zonal momentum The global wave converges eastward zonal momentum to the equator and deposits westward momentum at intermediate latitudes during spinup and before superrotation emerges
and the baroclinic instability ceases once superrotation is established A global barotropic mode of zonal wavenumber one generated by a mix of high- and low-latitude barotropic instability is responsible for maintaining superrotation in the statistically steady state At intermediate thermal Rossby numbers momentum flux by the global baroclinic mode is subdominant relative to smaller baroclinic modes
We report the discovery of HAT-P-25b a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the V = 13 19 G5 dwarf star GSC 1788-01237 with a period P = 3 652836 +/- 0 000019 days transit epoch Tc = 2455176 85173 +/- 0 00047 (BJD) and transit duration 0 1174 +/- 0 0017 days
The host star has mass of 1 01 +/- 0 03 M(Sun) radius of 0 96 +(0 05)-(0 04) R(Sun) effective temperature 5500 +/- 80 K and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0 31 +/- 0 08 The planetary companion has a mass of 0 567 +/- 0 022 M(Jup) and radius of 1
Comparing these observations with recent theoretical models we find that HAT-P-25b is consistent with a hydrogen-helium dominated gas giant planet with negligible core mass and age 3 2 +/- 2 3 Gyr The properties of HAT-P-25b support several previously observed correlations for planets in the mass range 0 4 &lt; M &lt; 0
including those of core mass vs metallicity planet radius vs equilibrium temperature and orbital period vs planet mass We also note that HAT-P-25b orbits the faintest star found by HATNet to have a transiting planet to date and is one of only a very few number of planets discovered from the ground orbiting a star fainter than V = 13
Glint the specular reflection of sunlight off Earth&#39;s oceans may reveal the presence of oceans on an extrasolar planet As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the fraction of illuminated disk while the reflectivity of this spot increases Both effects change the planet&#39;s visible reflectivity as a function of phase
However strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet&#39;s reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption Here we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds
We use the NASA Astrobiology Institute&#39;s Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3-D line-by-line multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth&#39;s broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit Our validated simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations We find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100% brighter at crescent phases than simulations that do not include glint
Interior to the gaseous envelopes of Saturn Uranus and Neptune there are high-density cores with masses larger than 10 Earth masses According to the conventional sequential accretion hypothesis such massive cores are needed for the onset of efficient accretion of their gaseous envelopes However Jupiter&#39;s gaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those of Saturn
In order to account for this structural diversity and the super-solar metallicity in the envelope of Jupiter and Saturn we investigate the possibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumed several Earth-mass proto-planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretion of their envelope In general
impinging sub-Earth-mass planetesimals disintegrate in gas giants&#39; envelopes deposit heavy elements well outside the cores and locally suppress the convection Consequently their fragments sediment to promote the growth of cores Through a series of numerical simulations we show that it is possible for colliding super-Earth-mass embryos to reach the cores of gas giants
Direct parabolic collisions also lead to the coalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores In these cases the energy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughout the envelope and the erosion of the cores This dichotomy contributes to the observed dispersion in the internal structure and atmospheric composition between Jupiter and Saturn and other gas giant planets and elsewhere
We present the results of a Spitzer photometric investigation into the IR excesses of close binary systems In a sample of 10 objects excesses in IRAC and MIPS24 bands implying the presence of warm dust are found for 3 For 2 objects we do not find excesses reported in earlier IRAS studies
We discuss the results in the context of the scenario suggested by Rhee and co-workers in which warm dust is continuously created by destructive collisions between planetary bodies A simple numerical model for the steady-state distribution of dust in one IR excess system shows a central clearing of radius 0
We study the effects of diffusion on the non-linear corotation torque or horseshoe drag in the two-dimensional limit focusing on low-mass planets for which the width of the horseshoe region is much smaller than the scale height of the disc In the absence of diffusion the non-linear corotation torque saturates
leaving only the Lindblad torque Diffusion of heat and momentum can act to sustain the corotation torque In the limit of very strong diffusion the linear corotation torque is recovered For the case of thermal diffusion this limit corresponds to having a locally isothermal equation of state We present some simple models that are able to capture the dependence of the torque on diffusive processes to within 20% of the numerical simulations
We describe a parallel hybrid symplectic integrator for planetary system integration that runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU) The integrator identifies close approaches between particles and switches from symplectic to Hermite algorithms for particles that require higher resolution integrations The integrator is approximately as accurate as other hybrid symplectic integrators but is GPU accelerated
We report radial velocity measurements of the G-type subgiants 24 Sextanis (=HD90043) and HD200964 Both are massive evolved stars that exhibit periodic variations due to the presence of a pair of Jovian planets Photometric monitoring with the T12 0 80m APT at Fairborn Observatory demonstrates both stars to be constant in brightness to &lt;= 0
thus strengthening the planetary interpretation of the radial velocity variations 24 Sex b c have orbital periods of 453 8 days and 883~days corresponding to semimajor axes 1 333 AU and 2 08 AU and minimum masses (Msini) 1 99 Mjup and 0 86 Mjup assuming a stellar mass 1
HD200964 b c have orbital periods of 613 8 days and 825 days corresponding to semimajor axes 1 601 AU and 1 95 AU and minimum masses 1 85 Mjup and 0 90 Mjup assuming M* = 1 44 Msun We also carry out dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactions between the planets
Most if not all of the dynamically stable solutions include crossing orbits suggesting that each system is locked in a mean motion resonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability The planets in the 24 Sex system likely have a period ratio near 2 1 while the HD200964 system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4
We carry out a series of high-resolution (1024 X 1024) hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the orbital evolution of a Saturn-Jupiter pair embedded in a gaseous disk This work extends the results of our previous work by exploring a different orbital configuration---Jupiter lies outside Saturn (q&lt;1 where q= M_i/M_o is the mass ratio of the inner planet and the outer one)
We focus on the effects of different initial separations (d) between the two planets and the various surface density profiles of the disk where \sigma \propto r^{-\alpha} We also compare the results of different orbital configurations of the planet pair Our results show that (1) when the initial separation is relatively large(d&gt;d_{iLr}
where d_{iLr} is the distance between Jupiter and its first inner Lindblad resonance) the two planets undergo divergent migration However the inward migration of Saturn could be halted when Jupiter compresses the inner disk in which Saturn is embedded (2) Convergent migration occurs when the initial separation is smaller (d&lt;d_{iLr}) and the density slope of the disk is nearly flat (\alpha&lt;1/2)
Saturn is then forced by Jupiter to migrate inward when the two planets are trapped into mean motion resonances (MMRs) and Saturn may get very close to the central star (3) In the case of q&lt;1 the eccentricity of Saturn could be excited to a very high value (e_{S}~0 4-0
The study of total ozone columns above Kiev and variations of ozone concentrations in the troposphere at different altitudes above Kiev was carried out using ground-based Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometric observations that are taken on a routine basis at the Main Astronomical Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (MAO NASU)
This study was performed within the framework of the international ESA-NIVR-KNMI OMI-AO project no 2907 entitled OMI validation by ground-based remote sensing ozone columns and atmospheric profiles during the time frame 2005-2008 The infrared FTIR spectral observations of direct solar radiation in the wavelength range of 2-12 micron as transmitted through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere were performed during the months of April-October of each year
The aim of the project was the validation of total ozone columns and vertical ozone profiles as obtained by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)) onboard of the NASA EOS-Aura scientific satellite platform The modeling of the ozone spectral band shape near 9 6 microns was performing with the MODTRAN code and a molecular band model based on the HITRAN-2004 molecular database
The a-priori information for the spectral modeling consisted of water vapor and temperature profiles from the NASA EOS-Aqua-AIRS satellite instrument stratospheric ozone profiles from the NASA EOS-Aura-MLS satellite instrument TEMIS-KNMI climatological ozone profiles and surface ozone concentration measurements performed at the specific times of infrared spectra observations The troposphere ozone variability was analyzed for two typical episodes
Aims Current and upcoming space missions may be able to detect moons of transiting extra-solar planets In this context it is important to understand if exomoons are expected to exist and what their possible properties are Methods Using estimates for the stability of exomoon orbits from numerical studies a list of 87 known transiting exoplanets is tested for the potential to host large exomoons
Results For 92% of the sample moons larger than Luna can be excluded on prograde orbits unless the parent exoplanet&#39;s internal structure is very different from the gas-giants of the solar system Only WASP-24b OGLE2-TR-L9 CoRoT-3b and CoRoT-9b could have moons above 0 4 m\oplus which is within the likely detection capabilities of current observational facilities
Recent discoveries of several transiting planets with clearly non-zero eccentricities and some large inclinations started changing the simple picture of close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits Two major scenarios to form such planets are planet migration in a disk and planet--planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation The former scenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit
while the latter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly high-obliquity orbit which are then circularized and aligned via tidal dissipation We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on eccentric orbits We show that the current and future orbital evolution of these systems is likely dominated by tidal dissipation
and not by a more distant companion Although most of these close-in planets experience orbital decay all the way to the Roche limit there are two characteristic evolution paths for them depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation inside the star and the planet We point out that the current observations may be consistent with one of them
Our results suggest that at least some of the close-in planets with non-zero orbital eccentricity may have been formed by tidally circularizing an initially eccentric orbit We also find that even when the stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present some systems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past
We report the discovery of CoRoT-8b a dense small Saturn-class exoplanet that orbits a K1 dwarf in 6 2 days and we derive its orbital parameters mass and radius We analyzed two complementary data sets the photometric transit curve of CoRoT-8b as measured by CoRoT and the radial velocity curve of CoRoT-8 as measured by the HARPS spectrometer
We find that CoRoT-8b is on a circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0 063 +/- 0 001 AU It has a radius of 0 57 +/- 0 02 RJ a mass of 0 22 +/- 0 03 MJ and therefore a mean density 1 6 +/- 0 1 g/cm^3
With 67 % of the size of Saturn and 72 % of its mass CoRoT-8b has a density comparable to that of Neptune (1 76 g/cm^3) We estimate its content in heavy elements to be 47-63 Earth masses and the mass of its hydrogen-helium envelope to be 7-23 Earth masses
We present observations of seven transits and seven eclipses of the transiting planet system HD 189733 taken with Spitzer IRAC at 8 microns We use a new correction for the detector ramp variation with a double-exponential function Our main findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the day-side planet flux of 2
with an average accuracy of 3 seconds; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet&#39;s phase variation finding the night side is 64% as bright as the day side
as well as an upper limit on the night-side variability of 17% (68% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 micron causing the phase function to peak 3 5 hrs before secondary eclipse confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 micron photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit
which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb-darkening of the star in agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 sec
which is mostly accounted for by a 31 sec light travel time delay and 33 sec delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse; and (10) high precision measurements of the parameters of this system
We introduce the CoRoT detrend algorithm (CDA) for detrending CoRoT stellar light curves The algorithm CDA has the capability to remove random jumps and systematic trends encountered in typical CoRoT data in a fully automatic fashion Since enormous jumps in flux can destroy the information content of a light curve
such an algorithm is essential From a study of 1030 light curves in the CoRoT IRa01 field we developed three simple assumptions which upon CDA is based We describe the algorithm analytically and provide some examples of how it works We demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm in the cases of CoRoT0102702789
Gas has been detected in a number of debris disk systems This gas may have arisen from grain sublimation or grain photodesorption It interacts with the surrounding dust grains through a number of charge and heat exchanges Studying the chemical composition and physical state of this gas can therefore reveal much about the dust component in these debris disks
We have produced a new code ontario to address gas emission from dusty gas-poor disks around A--F stars This code computes the gas ionization and thermal balance self-consistently with particular care taken of heating/cooling mechanisms Line emission spectra are then produced for each species (up to zinc) by statistical equilibrium calculations of the atomic/ionic energy levels
For parameters that resemble the observed beta Pictoris gas disk we find that the gas is primarily heated by photoelectric emission from dust grains and primarily cooled through the CII 157 7 micron line emission The gas can be heated to a temperature that is warmer than that of the dust and may in some cases reach temperature for thermal escape
The dominant cooling line CII 157 7 micron should be detectable by Herschel in these disks while the OI 63 2 micron line will be too faint We also study the dependence of the cooling line fluxes on a variety of disk parameters in light of the much improved sensitivity to thermal line emission in the mid/far infrared and at sub-millimeter wavelengths provided by
More than a decade of dedicated experimental work on the collisional physics of protoplanetary dust has brought us to a point at which the growth of dust aggregates can - for the first time - be self-consistently and reliably modelled In this article the emergent collision model for protoplanetery dust aggregates (Güttler et al
It turns out that after a brief period of rapid collisional growth of fluffy dust aggregates to sizes of a few centimeters the protoplanetary dust particles are subject to bouncing collisions in which their porosity is considerably decreased The model results also show that low-velocity fragmentation can reduce the final mass of the dust aggregates but that it does not trigger a new growth mode as discussed previously
We have performed extensive simulations to explore the possibility of detecting eclipses and transits of close sub-stellar and planetary companions to white dwarfs in WASP light-curves Our simulations cover companions $\sim0 3\Re&lt;{\rm R}_{pl}&lt;12\Re$ and orbital periods $2{\rm h}&lt;P&lt;15{\rm d}$ equivalent to orbital radii $0 003{\rm AU} &lt; a &lt; 0
For Gaussian random noise WASP is sensitive to transits by companions as small as the Moon orbiting a $\textrm{V}\simeq$12 white dwarf For fainter white dwarfs WASP is sensitive to increasingly larger radius bodies However in the presence of correlated noise structure in the light-curves the sensitivity drops although Earth-sized companions remain detectable in principle even in low S/N data
Mars-sized and even Mercury-sized bodies yield reasonable detection rates in high-quality light-curves with little residual noise We searched for eclipses and transit signals in long-term light-curves of a sample of 194 white dwarfs resulting from a cross-correlation of the McCook $&amp;$ Sion catalogue and the WASP archive No evidence for eclipsing or transiting sub-stellar and planetary companions was found
We used this non-detection and results from our simulations to place tentative upper limits to the frequency of such objects in close orbits at white dwarfs While only weak limits can be placed on the likely frequency of Earth-sized or smaller companions brown dwarfs and gas giants (radius $\approx \Rjup$) with periods $&lt;0
More stringent constraints likely requires significantly larger white dwarf samples higher observing cadence and continuous coverage The short duration of eclipses and transits of white dwarfs compared to the cadence of WASP observations appears to be one of the main factors limiting the detection rate in a survey optimised for planetary transits of main sequence stars
We introduce a novel search technique that can identify trans-neptunian objects in three to five exposures of a pointing within a single Hubble Space Telescope orbit The process is fast enough to allow the discovery of candidates soon after the data are available This allows sufficient time to schedule follow up observations with HST within a month
We report the discovery of 14 slow-moving objects found within 5\circ of the ecliptic in archival data taken with the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys The luminosity function of these objects is consistent with previous ground-based and space-based results We show evidence that the size distribution of both high and low inclination populations is similar for objects smaller than 100 km
as expected from collisional evolution models while their size distribution differ for brighter objects We suggest the two populations formed in different parts of the protoplanetary disk and after being dynamically mixed have collisionally evolved together Among the objects discovered there is an equal mass binary with an angular separation ~ 0
Using Gauss&#39; averaged equations we compute the secular relativistic effects generated by the Sun on the argument of the perihelion and the mean anomaly of an orbit Then we test different alternative simpler models that have been proposed to reproduce the secular relativistic effects in the orbital elements Generally models introduce artificial perturbations that are velocity-independent but that depend on the heliocentric distance
If these perturbations are set as an impulse in a constant timestep integrator when the particle approaches perihelion the generated impulse could be very strong and badly sampled originating a spurious orbital evolution In order to overcome this setback we propose two new models based on a constant distance-independent perturbation
The intense irradiation received by hot Jupiters suppresses convection in the outer layers of their atmospheres and lowers their cooling rates &#34;Inflated&#34; hot Jupiters i e those with anomalously large transit radii require additional sources of heat or suppressed cooling We consider the effect of forced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer
which could be driven by atmospheric circulation or by another mechanism Due to stable stratification in the atmosphere forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat Weak turbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process as if the planet was irradiated more intensely Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the convective interior
provided the turbulence extends to the radiative-convective boundary This inflates the planet until a balance is reached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior We also include the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or other effects Such heating is already known to slow planetary cooling
We find that dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the threshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior Strong turbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO may be necessary to explain stratospheric thermal inversions We show that the amount of mixing required to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism
This possible refutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study Our inflation mechanism requires a deep stratified layer that only exists when the absorbed stellar flux greatly exceeds the intrinsic emitted flux Thus it would be less effective for more luminous brown dwarfs and for longer period gas giants including Jupiter and Saturn
Orbital evolution of an interplanetary dust particle under action of an interstellar gas flow is investigated Secular time derivatives of the particle orbital elements for arbitrary orbit orientation are presented An important result concerns secular evolution of semi-major axis Secular semi-major axis of the particle on a bound orbit decreases under the action of fast interstellar gas flow
Possible types of evolution of other Keplerian orbital elements are discussed The paper compares influences of the Poynting-Robertson effect the radial solar wind and the interstellar gas flow on dynamics of the dust particle in outer planetary region of the Solar System and beyond it up to 100 AU <br>Evolution of putative dust ring in the zone of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt is studied
Also non-radial solar wind and gravitational effect of major planets may play an important role Low inclination orbits of micron-sized dust particles in the belt are not stable due to fast increase of eccentricity caused by the interstellar gas flow and subsequent planetary perturbations - the increase of eccentricity leads to planet crossing orbits of the particles
<br>Gravitational and non-gravitational effects are treated in a way which fully respects physics As a consequence some of the published results turned out to be incorrect Moreover the paper treats the problem in a more general way than it has been presented up to now <br>The influence of the fast interstellar neutral gas flow might not be ignored in modeling of evolution of dust particles beyond planets
We show existence of strong negative correlation between the temporal variations of magnetic field toroidal component of the solar tachocline (the bottom of convective zone) and the Earth magnetic field (Y-component) The possibility that hypothetical solar axions which can transform into photons in external electric or magnetic fields (the inverse Primakoff effect)
can be the instrument by which the magnetic field of convective zone of the Sun modulates the magnetic field of the Earth is considered We propose the axion mechanism of &#34;solar dynamo-geodynamo&#34; connection where an energy of axions which form in the Sun core is modulated at first by the magnetic field of the solar tachocline zone (due to the inverse coherent Primakoff effect) and after that is absorbed in the liquid core of the Earth under influence of the terrestrial magnetic field
We report on the discovery of WASP-37b a transiting hot Jupiter orbiting a mv = 12 7 G2-type dwarf with a period of 3 577471 \pm 0 00001 d transit epoch T0 = 2455338 6188 \pm 0 0006 (HJD) and a transit duration 0 1304 \pm 0 0018 d The planetary companion has a mass Mp = 1
yielding a mean density of 1 15 \pm 0 15 times that of Jupiter From a spectral analysis and comparisons with stellar models we find the host star has M* = 0 925 \pm 0 120 Msun R* = 1 003 \pm 0 053 Rsun Teff = 5800 \pm 150 K and [Fe/H] = -0
Light refracted by the planet&#39;s atmosphere is usually ignored in analysis of planetary transits Here we show that refraction can add shoulders to the transit light curve i e an increase in the observed flux mostly just before and after transit During transit light may be refracted away from the observer
Therefore even completely transparent planets will display a very similar signal to that of a standard transit i e that of an opaque planet We provide analytical expression for the amount of additional light deflected towards the observer before the transit and show that the effect may be as large as $10^{-4}$ of the stellar light and therefore measurable by current instruments
By observing this effect we can directly measure the scale height of the planet&#39;s atmosphere We also consider the attenuation of starlight in the planetary atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering and discuss the conditions under which the atmospheric lensing effect is most prominent We show that for planets on orbital periods larger than about 70 days
By using a hydrodynamic atmospheric escape mechanism \citep{amit09} we show how the unusually high mass density of Quaoar could have been predicted (constrained) without any knowledge of a binary companion We suggest an explanation of the recent spectroscopic observations of Orcus and Charon \citep{delsanti10 cook07} We present a simple relation between the detection of certain volatile ices and the body mass density and diameter
We report the discovery of HAT-P-24b a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the moderately bright V=11 818 F8 dwarf star GSC 0774-01441 with a period P = 3 3552464 +/- 0 0000071 d transit epoch Tc = 2455216 97669 +/- 0 00024 (BJD_UTC) and transit duration 3 653 +/- 0 025 hours
The host star has a mass of 1 191 +/- 0 042 Msun radius of 1 317 +/- 0 068 Rsun effective temperature 6373 +/- 80 K and a low metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0 16 +/- 0 08 The planetary companion has a mass of 0 681 +/- 0
and radius of 1 243 +/- 0 072 RJ yielding a mean density of 0 439 +/- 0 069 g cm-3 By repeating our global fits with different parameter sets we have performed a critical investigation of the fitting techniques used for previous HAT planetary discoveries We find that the system properties are robust against the choice of priors
The effects of fixed versus fitted limb darkening are also examined HAT-P-24b probably maintains a small eccentricity of e = 0 052 +0 022 -0 017 which is accepted over the circular orbit model with false alarm probability 5 8% In the absence of eccentricity pumping this result suggests HAT-P-24b experiences less tidal dissipation than Jupiter
For transiting planets the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the sky-projected angle beta between the stellar rotation axis and a planet&#39;s orbital axis Using the HARPS spectrograph we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for six transiting hot Jupiters found by the WASP consortium We combine these with long term radial velocity measurements obtained with CORALIE
We found that three of our targets have a projected spin-orbit angle above 90 degrees WASP-2b beta = 153 (+11 -15) WASP-15b beta = 139 6 (+5 2 -4 3) and WASP-17b beta = 148 5 (+5 1 -4 2); the other three (WASP-4b WASP-5b and WASP-18b) have angles compatible with 0 degrees
There is no dependence between the misaligned angle and planet mass nor with any other planetary parameter All orbits are close to circular with only one firm detection of eccentricity on WASP-18b with e = 0 00848 (+0 00085 -0 00095) No long term radial acceleration was detected for any of the targets
Combining all previous 20 measurements of beta and our six we attempt to statistically determine the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle psi and find that between about 45 and 85 % of hot Jupiters have psi &gt; 30 degrees Observations and predictions using the Kozai mechanism match well If these observational facts are confirmed in the future
Recent observations have shown that in many exoplanetary systems the spin axis of the parent star is misaligned with the planet&#39;s orbital axis These have been used to argue against the scenario that short-period planets migrated to their present-day locations due to tidal interactions with their natal discs However this interpretation is based on the assumption that the spins of young stars are parallel to the rotation axes of protostellar discs around them
We show that the interaction between a magnetic star and its circumstellar disc can (but not always) have the effect of pushing the stellar spin axis away from the disc angular momentum axis toward the perpendicular state and even the retrograde state Planets formed in the disc may therefore have their orbital axes misaligned with the stellar spin axis
We present the first dynamical solution of the triple asteroid system (45) Eugenia and its two moons Petit-Prince (Diameter~7 km) and S/2004 (45) 1 (Diameter~5 km) The two moons orbit at 1165 and 610 km from the primary describing an almost-circular orbit (e~6x10-3 and e~7x10-2 respectively) The system is quite different from the other known triple systems in the main belt since the inclinations of the moon orbits are sizeable (9 deg and 18 deg with respect to the equator of the primary respectively)
No resonances neither secular nor due to Lidov-Kozai mechanism were detected in our dynamical solution suggesting that these inclinations are not due to excitation modes between the primary and the moons A 10-year evolution study shows that the orbits are slightly affected by perturbations from the Sun and to a lesser extent by mutual interactions between the moons
With an average eccentricity of about 0 29 the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets is markedly different from the solar system Among other scenarios considered it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through planet-disc interaction Recently it has been noticed that the thermodynamical state of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of growing protoplanets
However the evolution of planetary eccentricity in radiative discs has not been considered yet In this paper we study the evolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a three-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc&#39;s effect on the orbital evolution of the planet We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation
The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to speed up the simulations First we measure the torque and power exerted on the planet by the disc for fixed orbits and then we let the planet start with initial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc For locally isothermal we confirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for planetary cores
In the case of radiative discs the planets experience an inward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold After the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin to migrate outward in radiative discs while higher mass cores always migrate inward For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find eccentricity damping
We investigate analytically the magnetic instability in a rotating and electrically conducting fluid induced by an imposed magnetic field with its associated electric current The short-wavelength approximation is used in the linear stability analysis i e the length scale of the imposed field is much larger than the wavelength of perturbations
The dispersion relationship is derived and then simplified to give the criteria for the onset of the magnetic instability in three cases of imposed field namely the axial dependence the radial dependence and the mixed case The orientation of rotation imposed field and imposed current is important for this instability
Based on long-slit infrared spectroscopic observations it has been suggested that half of the carbon monoxide present in the atmosphere of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) close to perihelion was released by a distributed source in the coma whose nature (dust or gas) remains unidentified We re-assess the origin of CO in Hale-Bopp&#39;s coma from millimeter interferometric data and a re-analysis of the IR lines
<br>Simultaneous observations of the CO J(1-0) (115 GHz) and J(2-1) (230 GHz) lines were undertaken with the IRAM interferometer in single-dish and interferometric modes The diversity of angular resolutions (from 1700 to 42000 km diameter at the comet) is suitable to study the radial distribution of CO and detect the extended source observed in the infrared
We used excitation and radiative transfer models to simulate the observations Various CO density distributions were considered including 3D time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations which reproduce a CO rotating jet The CO J(1-0) and J(2-1) observations can be consistently explained by a nuclear production of CO Composite 50 50 nuclear/extended productions with characteristic scale lengths of CO parent L_p &gt; 1500 km are rejected
<br>Based on similar radiation transfer calculations we show that the CO v = 1-0 ro-vibrational lines observed in comet Hale-Bopp at heliocentric distances less than 1 5 AU are severely optically thick The broad extent of the CO brightness distribution in the infrared is mainly due to optical depth effects
We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD189733b obtained at 3 6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope Previous measurements at 3 6 microns suffered from strong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on the water detection by comparison of the 3
We use a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3 6 microns The observation has been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode We are able to derive accurate system parameters including planet-to-star radius ratio
impact parameter scale of the system and central time of the transit from the fits of the transit light curve We compare the results with transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations at the same wavelength We obtained the following system parameters R_p/R_\star=0 15566+0 00011-0 00024 b=0 661+0
and a/R_\star=8 925+0 0490-0 0523 at 3 6 microns These measurements are three times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they benefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic errors Nonetheless we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for stellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration photometric follow-up in the V-band
The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio corrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous measurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al 2009) We also discuss that water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius measured at 3 6 and 5 8 microns
While the population of main sequence debris discs is well constrained little is known about debris discs around evolved stars This paper provides a theoretical framework considering the effects of stellar evolution on debris discs particularly the production and loss of dust within them Here we repeat a steady state model fit to disc evolution statistics for main sequence A stars
this time using realistic grain optical properties then evolve that population to consider its detectability at later epochs Our model predicts that debris discs around giant stars are harder to detect than on the main sequence because radiation pressure is more effective at removing small dust around higher luminosity stars
Just 12% of first ascent giants within 100pc are predicted to have discs detectable with Herschel at 160um However this is subject to the uncertain effect of sublimation on the disc which we propose can thus be constrained with such observations Our model also finds that the rapid decline in stellar luminosity results in only very young white dwarfs having luminous discs
As such systems are on average at larger distances they are hard to detect but we predict that the stellar parameters most likely to yield a disc detection are a white dwarf at 200pc with cooling age of 0 1Myr in line with observations of the Helix Nebula Our model does not predict close-in (&lt;0
Using a model of force balance in Saturn&#39;s disk-like magnetosphere we show that variations in hot plasma pressure can change the magnetic field configuration This effect changes (i) the location of the magnetopause even at fixed solar wind dynamic pressure and (ii) the magnetic mapping between ionosphere and disk The model uses equatorial observations as a boundary condition-we test its predictions over a wide latitude range by comparison with a Cassini high-inclination orbit of magnetic field and hot plasma pressure data
We report recent ground-based photometry of the transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ1214b at several wavelengths including the infrared near 1 25 microns (J-band) We observed a J-band transit with the FLAMINGOS infrared imager and the 2 1-meter telescope on Kitt Peak and we observed several optical transits using a 0 5-meter telescope on Kitt Peak and the 0
Our high-precision J-band observations exploit the brightness of the M-dwarf host star at this infrared wavelength as compared to the optical as well as being significantly less affected by stellar activity and limb darkening We fit the J-band transit to obtain an independent determination of the planetary and stellar radii
Our radius for the planet (2 61^+0 30_-0 11 Earth radii) is in excellent agreement with the discovery value reported by Charbonneau et al based on optical data We demonstrate that the planetary radius is insensitive to degeneracies in the fitting process We use all of our observations to improve the transit ephemeris
Transit light curves for stellar continua have only one minimum and a &#34;U&#34; shape By contrast transit curves for optically thin chromospheric emission lines can have a &#34;W&#34; shape because of stellar limb-brightening We calculate light curves for an optically thin shell of emission and fit these models to time-resolved observations of Si IV absorption by the planet HD209458b
We find that the best fit Si IV absorption model has R_p SIV/R_*= 0 34+0 07-0 12 similar to the Roche lobe of the planet While the large radius is only at the limit of statistical significance we develop formulae applicable to transits of all optically thin chromospheric emission lines
[Abridged] We present 2 12-2 23 um high contrast integral field spectroscopy of the extrasolar planet HR 8799 b Our observations were obtained with OSIRIS on the Keck II telescope and sample the 2 2 um CH4 feature which is useful for spectral classification and as a temperature diagnostic for ultracool objects
The spectrum of HR 8799 b is relatively featureless with little or no methane absorption and does not exhibit the strong CH4 seen in T dwarfs of similar absolute magnitudes Overall we find that HR 8799 b has a spectral type consistent with L5-T2 although its SED is atypical compared to most field objects
We fit the 2 2 um spectrum and the infrared SED using the Hubeny &amp; Burrows Burrows et al and Ames-Dusty model atmosphere grids which incorporate nonequilibrium chemistry non-solar metallicities and clear and cloudy variants No models agree with all of the data but those with intermediate clouds produce significantly better fits
The largest discrepancy occurs in the J-band which is highly suppressed in HR 8799 b The best-fitting effective temperatures range from 1300-1700 K with radii between ~0 3-0 5 RJup These values are inconsistent with evolutionary model-derived values of 800-900 K and 1 1-1 3 RJup based on the luminosity of HR 8799 b and the age of HR 8799
a discrepancy that probably results from imperfect atmospheric models or the limited range of physical parameters covered by the models The low temperature inferred from evolutionary models indicates that HR 8799 b is ~400 K cooler than field L/T transition objects providing further evidence that the L/T transition is gravity-dependent
We investigate potential biases in the measurements of exoplanet orbital parameters obtained from radial velocity observations for single-planet systems We create a mock catalog of radial velocity data choosing input planet masses periods and observing patterns from actual radial velocity surveys and varying input eccentricities We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations and compare the resulting orbital parameters to the input values
We find that a combination of the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the data the maximal gap in phase coverage and the total number of periods covered by observations is a good predictor of the quality of derived orbit parameters As eccentricity is positive definite we find that eccentricities of planets on nearly circular orbits are preferentially overestimated
with typical bias of 1-2 times the median eccentricity uncertainty in a survey (e g 0 04 in the Butler et al 2006 catalog) When performing population analysis we recommend using the mode of the marginalized posterior eccentricity distribution to minimize potential biases While the Butler et al (2006) catalog reports eccentricities below 0
we estimate that the true fraction of e &lt; 0 05 orbits is about f(0 05)=38\pm 9% For planets with P &gt; 10 days we find f(0 05)=28\pm 8% versus 10% from Butler et al (2006) These planets either never acquired a large eccentricity or were circularized following any significant eccentricity excitation
If an orbit is fitted from combined RV and astrometric data the orbit should be physically consistent with both data sets The Keplerian orbit of a planet is a highly nonlinear function of seven parameters The astrometric orbit problem can be partially linearized via transformation to four linear parameters (related four Thiele-Innes constants) plus three nonlinear parameters
eccentricity period and periastron time The RV orbit problem can be partially linearized via transformation to two additional linear parameters plus the same three nonlinear parameters Unfortunately the two linear parameters from RV are not linearly related to the four linear parameters from astrometry Because of this difficulty currently available algorithms for fitting combined RV and astrometric data to multiple-planet systems employ at least five nonlinear parameters per planet
We have developed a new algorithm for fitting orbits of multiple planet systems from combined data sets of radial velocity and astrometric measurements The new algorithm satisfies the RV-astrometry consistency requirement while using three nonlinear parameters per planet We expect the reduction in nonlinearity to give the algorithm a significant advantage in computation speed over existing algorithms
CoRoT-3b is a 22 Jupiter-mass massive-planet/brown-dwarf object orbiting an F3-star with a period of 4 3 days We analyzed the out-of-transit CoRoT-3 red-channel lightcurve obtained by the CoRoT mission and detected the ellipsoidal modulation with half the orbital period and amplitude of 59+/-9 ppm (parts per million) and the relativistic beaming effect
Abridged We have performed an ecliptic survey of the Kuiper belt with an areal coverage of 8 9 square degrees to a 50% limiting magnitude of r&#39;=24 7 and have detected 88 Kuiper belt objects roughly half of which received follow-up one to two months after detection Using this survey data alone
we have measured the luminosity function of the Kuiper belt thus avoiding any biases that might come from the inclusion of other observations We have found that the Cold population defined as having inclinations less than 5 degrees has a luminosity function slope alpha=0 82+-0 23 and is different from the Hot population
which has inclinations greater than 5 degrees and a luminosity function slope alpha=0 35+-0 21 As well we have found that those objects closer than 38 AU have virtually the same luminosity function slope as the Hot population This result along with similar findings of past surveys demonstrates that the dynamically cold Kuiper belt objects likely have a steep size distribution
and are unique from all of the excited populations which have much shallower distributions This suggests that the dynamically excited population underwent a different accretion history and achieved a more evolved state of accretion than the cold population As well we discuss the similarities of the Cold and Hot populations with the size distributions of other planetesimal populations
We find that while the Jupiter family comets and the scattered disk exhibit similar size distributions a power-law extrapolation to small sizes for the scattered disk cannot account for the observed influx of comets As well we have found that the Jupiter Trojan and Hot populations cannot have originated from the same parent popuation
Eclipse exoplanet spectroscopy has yielded detection of H_2O CH_4 CO_2 and CO in the atmosphere of hot jupiters and neptunes About 40 large terrestrial planets are announced or confirmed two of which are transiting and another deemed habitable Hence the potential for eclipse spectroscopy of terrestrial planets with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has become an active field of study
We explore the parameter space (type of stars planet orbital periods and types and instruments/wavelengths) in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) achievable on the detection of spectroscopic features We use analytic formula and model data for both the astrophysical scene and the instrument to plot S/N contour maps while indicating how the S/N scales with the fixed parameters
We systematically compare stellar photon noise-only figures with ones including detailed instrumental and zodiacal noises Likelihood of occurring targets is based both on model and catalog star population of the solar neighborhood The 9 6 micron ozone band is detectable (S/N = 3) with JWST for a warm super-earth 6
using ~2% of the 5-year nominal mission time (summing observations M4V and lighter host star for primary eclipses M5V for secondary) If every star up to this mass limit and distance were to host a habitable planet there should be statistically ~1 eclipsing case Investigation of systematic noises in the co-addition of 5 years worth-
Debris disc analysis and modelling provide crucial information about the structure and the processes at play in extrasolar planetary systems In binary systems this issue is more complex because the disc should in addition respond to the companion star&#39;s perturbations We explore the dynamical evolution of a collisionally active debris disc for different initial parent body populations
diverse binary configurations and optical depths We focus on the radial extent and size distribution of the disc at a stationary state We numerically follow the evolution of $10^{5}$ massless small grains initially produced from a circumprimary disc of parent bodies following a size distribution in $dN \propto s^{-3 5}$ds
Grains are submitted to both stars&#39; gravity as well as radiation pressure In addition particles are assigned an empirically derived collisional lifetime For all the binary configurations the disc extends far beyond the critical semimajor axis $a_crit$ for orbital stability This is due to the steady production of small grains
placed on eccentric orbits reaching beyond $a_crit$ by radiation pressure The amount of matter beyond acrit depends on the balance between collisional production and dynamical removal rates it increases for more massive discs as well as for eccentric binaries Another important effect is that in the dynamically stable region the disc is depleted from its smallest grains
Both results could lead to observable signatures We have shown that a companion star can never fully truncate a collisionally active disc For eccentric companions grains in the unstable regions can significantly contribute to the thermal emission in the mid-IR Discs with sharp outer edges especially bright ones such as HR4796A
Chondrules are important early Solar System materials that can provide a wealth of information on conditions in the solar nebula if their formation mechanism can be understood The theory most consistent with observational constraints especially thermal histories is the so-called &#34;shock model&#34; in which chondrules were melted in solar nebula shocks
However several problems have been identified with previous shock models These problems all pertained to the treatment of the radiation field namely the input boundary condition to the radiation field the proper treatment of the opacity of solids and the proper treatment of molecular line cooling In this paper we present the results of our updated shock model
which corrects for the problems listed above Our new hydrodynamic shock code includes a complete treatment of molecular line cooling due to H2O Previously shock models including line cooling predicted chondrule cooling rates exceeding 100 000 K/hr Contrary to these expectations we have found that the effect of line cooling is minimal; after the inclusion of line cooling
the cooling rates of chondrules are 10-1000 K/hr The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable to line cooling is due to a combination of factors including buffering due to hydrogen recombination/dissociation high column densities of water and backwarming Our model demonstrates that the shock model for chondrule formation remains consistent with observational constraints
We present ground-based optical observations of the September 2009 and January 2010 transits of HD 80606b Based on 3 partial light curves of the September 2009 event we derive a midtransit time of T_c [HJD] = 2455099 196 +- 0 026 which is about 1 sigma away from the previously predicted time
We observed the January 2010 event from 9 different locations with most phases of the transit being observed by at least 3 different teams We determine a midtransit time of T_c [HJD] = 2455210 6502 +- 0 0064 which is within 1 3 sigma of the time derived from a Spitzer observation of the same event
Piernik is a multi-fluid grid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code based on the Relaxing Total Variation Diminishing (RTVD) conservative scheme The original code has been extended by addition of dust described within the particle approximation The dust is now described as a system of interacting particles The particles can interact with gas
In this paper we present our HARPS radial-velocity data for eight low-activity solar-type stars belonging to the HARPS volume-limited sample HD6718 HD8535 HD28254 HD290327 HD43197 HD44219 HD148156 and HD156411 Keplerian fits to these data reveal the presence of low-mass companions around these targets With minimum masses ranging from 0 58 to 2
In this contribution I summarize some recent successes and focus on remaining challenges in understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems in the context of the Blue Dots initiative Because our understanding is incomplete we cannot yet articulate a &#34;design reference mission&#34; engineering matrix suitable for an exploration mission where success is defined as obtaining a spectrum of a potentially habitable world around a nearby star
We consider the limiting case for orbital stability of the companions to HR 8799 This case is only consistent with ages for the system of ~100 Myr not with the 1 Gyr age proposed from astroseismology The discrepancy probably arises because the inclination of the star is smaller than assumed in analyzing the astroseismology data
Just two of 10 extrasolar planets found by microlensing have been detected by the planetary caustic despite the higher probability of planet detection relative to the central caustic which has been responsible for four extrasolar planet detections This is because the perturbations induced by the planetary caustic are unpredictable thus making it difficult to carry out strategic observations
However if future high-cadence monitoring surveys are conducted the majority of planetary caustic events including the events by free-floating planets and wide-separation planets would be detected Hence understanding the planetary caustic perturbations becomes important In this paper we investigate in detail the pattern of the planetary caustic perturbations From this study
we find three properties of the planetary caustic perturbations First planetary systems with the same star-planet separation (s) basically produce perturbations of constant strength regardless of the planet/star mass ratio (q) but the duration of each perturbation scales with sqrt{q} Second close planetary systems with the same separation produce essentially the same negative perturbations between two triangular-shaped caustics regardless of q
but the duration of the perturbations scales with sqrt{q} Third the positive perturbations for planetary systems with the same mass ratio become stronger as the caustic shrinks with the increasing |log s| while the negative perturbations become weaker We estimate the degeneracy in the determination of q that occurs in planetary caustic events
From this we find that the mass ratio can be more precisely determined as q increases and |log s| decreases We also find that the degeneracy range of events for which the source star passes close to the planetary caustic is usually very narrow and thus it would not significantly affect the determination of q
We report the discovery of a brown dwarf that transits one member of the M+M binary system LHS6343AB every 12 71 days The transits were discovered using photometric data from the Kelper public data release The LHS6343 stellar system was previously identified as a single high-proper-motion M dwarf We use high-contrast imaging to resolve the system into two low-mass stars with masses 0
respectively and a projected separation of 55 arcsec High-resolution spectroscopy shows that the more massive component undergoes Doppler variations consistent with Keplerian motion with a period equal to the transit period and an amplitude consistent with a companion mass of M_C = 62 8 +/- 2 3 Mjup Based on an analysis of the Kepler light curve we estimate the radius of the companion to be R_C = 0
We report the discovery of HAT-P-17b c a multi-planet system with an inner transiting planet in a short-period eccentric orbit and an outer planet in a 4 8 yr nearly circular orbit The inner planet HAT-P-17b transits the bright V = 10 54 early K dwarf star GSC 2717-00417 with an orbital period P = 10
orbital eccentricity e = 0 346 +/- 0 007 transit epoch T_c = 2454801 16945 +/- 0 00020 and transit duration 0 1691 +/- 0 0009 d HAT-P-17b has a mass of 0 530 +/- 0 018 M_J and radius of 1 010 +/- 0 029 R_J yielding a mean density of 0
This planet has a relatively low equilibrium temperature in the range 780-927 K making it an attractive target for follow-up spectroscopic studies The outer planet HAT-P-17c has a significantly longer orbital period P_2 = 1797^+58_-89 d and a minimum mass m_2 sin i_2 = 1 4^+1 1_-0 4 M_J The orbital inclination of HAT-P-17c is unknown as transits have not been observed and may not be present
We report photometric and radial velocity observations of the XO-4 transiting planetary system conducted with the FLWO 1 2m telescope and the 8 2m Subaru Telescope Based on the new light curves the refined transit ephemeris of XO-4b is $P = 4 1250828 \pm 0 0000040$ days and $T_c [BJD_TDB] = 2454485
We measured the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect of XO-4b and estimated the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis to be $\lambda = -46 7^{\circ} ^{+8 1^{\circ}}_{-6 1^{\circ}}$ This measurement of $\lambda$ is less robust than in some other cases because the impact parameter of the transit is small
causing a strong degeneracy between $\lambda$ and the projected stellar rotational velocity Nevertheless our finding of a spin-orbit misalignment suggests that the migration process for XO-4b involved few-body dynamics rather than interaction with a gaseous disk In addition our result conforms with the pattern reported by Winn et al (2010
The Penn State Pathfinder is a prototype warm fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph with a Hawaii-1 NIR detector that has already demonstrated 7-10 m/s radial velocity precision on integrated sunlight The Pathfinder testbed was initially setup for the Gemini PRVS design study to enable a systematic exploration of the challenges of achieving high radial velocity precision in the near-infrared
as well as to test possible solutions to these calibration challenges The current version of the Pathfinder has an R3 echelle grating and delivers a resolution of R~50 000 in the Y J or H bands of the spectrum We will discuss the on sky-performance of the Pathfinder during an engineering test run at the Hobby Eberly Telescope as well the results of velocity observations of M dwarfs
We will also discuss the unique calibration techniques we have explored like Uranium-Neon hollow cathode lamps notch filter and modal noise mitigation to enable high precision radial velocity observation in the NIR The Pathfinder is a prototype testbed precursor of a cooled high-resolution NIR spectrograph capable of high radial velocity precision and of finding low mass planets around mid-late M dwarfs
We present Ks H &amp; J-band photometry of the very highly irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-12b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope Our photometry brackets the secondary eclipse of WASP-12b in the Ks and H-bands and in J-band starts in mid-eclipse and continues until well after the end of the eclipse
We detect its thermal emission in all three near-infrared bands Our secondary eclipse depths are 0 309 +/- 0 013% in Ks-band (24-sigma) 0 176 +/- 0 020% in H-band (9-sigma) and 0 131 +/- 0 028% in J-band (4-sigma) All three secondary eclipses are best-fit with a consistent phase that is compatible with a circular orbit
By combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature as well as the radial velocity and transit timing data for this system we show that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate and show that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero Our thermal emission measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet&#39;s atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues in favour of inefficient day to nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly irradiated hot Jupiter
The J and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature and thus hint at the possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of WASP-12b; the high pressure deep atmospheric layers probed by our J and H-band observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer
Lastly our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than would otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being tidally stripped from the planet - as was predicted for this system by Li &amp; collaborators and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably provided by Fossati &amp; collaborators
We present a new particle module of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Piernik code The original multi-fluid grid code based on the Relaxing Total Variation Diminishing (RTVD) scheme has been extended by addition of dust described within the particle approximation The dust is now described as a system of interacting particles The particles can interact with gas
which is described as a fluid In this poster we introduce the scheme used to solve equations of motion for the particles and present the first results coming from the module The results of test problems are also compared with the results coming from fluid simulations made with Piernik-MHD code
There is no universally acknowledged criterion to distinguish brown dwarfs from planets Numerous studies have used or suggested a definition based on an object&#39;s mass taking the ~13-Jupiter mass (M_J) limit for the ignition of deuterium Here we investigate various deuterium-burning masses for a range of models We find that
while 13 M_J is generally a reasonable rule of thumb the deuterium fusion mass depends on the helium abundance the initial deuterium abundance the metallicity of the model and on what fraction of an object&#39;s initial deuterium abundance must combust in order for the object to qualify as having burned deuterium
Even though for most proto-brown dwarf conditions 50% of the initial deuterium will burn if the object&#39;s mass is ~(13 0 +/- 0 8)M_J the full range of possibilities is significantly broader For models ranging from zero-metallicity to more than three times solar metallicity the deuterium burning mass ranges from ~11
We discovered evidence for a possible additional 0 75 R_Earth transiting planet in the NASA EPOXI observations of the known M dwarf exoplanetary system GJ 436 Based on an ephemeris determined from the EPOXI data we predicted a transit event in an extant Spitzer Space Telescope 8 micron data set of this star
Our subsequent analysis of those Spitzer data confirmed the signal of the predicted depth and at the predicted time but we found that the transit depth was dependent on the aperture used to perform the photometry Based on these suggestive findings we gathered new Warm Spitzer Observations of GJ 436 at 4
The 4 5 micron data permit us to rule out a transit at high confidence and we conclude that the earlier candidate transit signals resulted from correlated noise in the EPOXI and Spitzer 8 micron observations In the course of this investigation we developed a novel method for correcting the intrapixel sensitivity variations of the 3
The search for life beyond the Solar System is a major activity in exoplanet science However even if an Earth-like planet were to be found it is unlikely to be at a similar stage of evolution as the modern Earth It is therefore of interest to investigate the sensitivity of biomarker signals for life as we know it for an Earth-like planet but at earlier stages of evolution
Here we assess biomarkers i e species almost exclusively associated with life in present-day and in 10% present atmospheric level oxygen atmospheres corresponding to the Earth&#39;s Proterozoic period We investigate the impact of proposed enhanced microbial emissions of the biomarker nitrous oxide which photolyses to form nitrogen oxides which can destroy the biomarker ozone
A major result of our work is regardless of the microbial activity producing nitrous oxide in the early anoxic ocean a certain minimum ozone column can be expected to persist in Proterozoic-type atmospheres due to a stabilising feedback loop between ozone nitrous oxide and the ultraviolet radiation field Atmospheric nitrous oxide columns were enhanced by a factor of 51 for the Proterozoic &#34;Canfield ocean&#34; scenario with 100 times increased nitrous oxide surface emissions
In such a scenario nitrous oxide displays prominent spectral features so may be more important as a biomarker than previously considered in such cases The run with &#34;Canfield ocean&#34; nitrous oxide emissions enhanced by a factor of 100 also featured additional surface warming of 3 5K Our results suggest that the Proterozoic ozone layer mostly survives the changes in composition which implies that it is indeed a good atmospheric biomarker
The search for extrasolar rocky planets has already found the first transiting rocky super-Earth Corot 7b with a surface temperature that allows for magma oceans Here we ask if we could distinguish rocky planets with recent major volcanism by remote observation We develop a model for volcanic eruptions on an Earth-like exoplanet based on the present day Earth
derive the observable features in emergent and transmission spectra for multiple scenarios of gas distribution and cloudcover We calculate the observation time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as secondary eclipse and discuss the likelihood of observing volcanism on transiting Earth to super-Earth sized exoplanets
We find that sulfur dioxide from large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest stars using ground based telescopes and report the frequency and magnitude of the expected signatures Transit probability of planet in the habitable zone decreases with distance to the host star
One of the principal scientific reasons for wanting to resume in situ exploration of the lunar surface is to gain access to the record it contains of early Solar System history Part of this record will pertain to the galactic environment of the Solar System including variations in the cosmic ray flux
energetic galactic events (e g supernovae and/or gamma-ray bursts) and passages of the Solar System through dense interstellar clouds Much of this record is of astrobiological interest as these processes may have affected the evolution of life on Earth and perhaps other Solar System bodies We argue that this galactic record
The planets magnetic field has been explained based on the dynamo theory which presents as many difficulties in mathematical terms as well as in predictions It proves to be extremely difficult to calculate the dipolar magnetic moment of the extrasolar planets using the dynamo theory The aim is to find an empirical relationship (justifying using first principles) between the planetary magnetic moment
the mass of the planet its rotation period and the electrical conductivity of its most conductive layer Then this is applied to Hot Jupiters Using all the magnetic planetary bodies of the solar system and tracing a graph of the dipolar magnetic moment versus body mass parameter the rotation period and electrical conductivity of the internal conductive layer is obtained
An empirical functional relation was constructed which was adjusted to a power law curve in order to fit the data Once this empirical relation has been defined it is theoretically justified and applied to the calculation of the dipolar magnetic moment of the extra solar planets known as Hot Jupiters
Almost all data calculated is interpolated bestowing confidence in terms of their validity The value for the dipolar magnetic moment obtained for the exoplanet Osiris (HD209458b) helps understand the way in which the atmosphere of a planet with an intense magnetic field can be eroded by stellar wind The relationship observed also helps understand why Venus and Mars do not present any magnetic field
We investigate the fragmentation criterion in massive self-gravitating discs We present new analysis of the fragmentation conditions which we test by carrying out global three-dimensional numerical simulations Whilst previous work has placed emphasis on the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale \beta we find that at a given radius the surface mass density (i
e disc mass and profile) and star mass also play a crucial role in determining whether a disc fragments or not as well as where in the disc fragments form We find that for shallow surface mass density profiles (p&lt;2 where \Sigma \propto R^{-p}) fragments form in the outer regions of the disc
However for steep surface mass density profiles (p \gtrsim 2) fragments form in the inner regions of a disc In addition we also find that the critical value of the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale found in previous simulations is only applicable to certain disc surface mass density profiles and for particular disc radii and is not a general rule for all discs
The majority of basaltic asteroids are found in the inner main belt although a few have also been observed in the outer main belt and near-Earth space These asteroids -referred to as V-types- have surface compositions that resemble that of the 530km sized asteroid Vesta Besides the compositional similarity dynamical evidence also links many V-type asteroids to Vesta
Moreover Vesta is one of the few asteroids to have been identified as source of specific classes of meteorites the howardite eucrite diogenite achondrites (HEDs) Despite the general consensus on the outlined scenario several questions remain unresolved In particular it is not clear if the observed spectral diversity among Vesta
V-types and HEDs is due to space weathering as is thought to be the case for S-type asteroids In this paper SDSS photometry is used to address the question of whether the spectral diversity among candidate V-types and HEDs can be explained by space weathering We show that visible spectral slopes of V-types are systematically redder with respect to HEDs
in a similar way to what is found for ordinary chondrite meteorites and S-types On the assumption that space weathering is responsible for the slope mismatch we estimated an upper limit for the reddening timescale of about 0 5Ga Nevertheless the observed slope mismatch between HEDs and V-types poses several puzzles to understanding its origin
We provide torque formulae for low mass planets undergoing type I migration in gaseous disks These torque formulae put special emphasis on the horseshoe drag which is prone to saturation the asymptotic value reached by the horseshoe drag depends on a balance between coorbital dynamics (which tends to cancel out or saturate the torque) and diffusive processes (which tend to restore the unperturbed disk profiles
thereby desaturating the torque) We entertain here the question of this asymptotic value and we derive torque formulae which give the total torque as a function of the disk&#39;s viscosity and thermal diffusivity The horseshoe drag features two components one which scales with the vortensity gradient and one which scales with the entropy gradient
and which constitutes the most promising candidate for halting inward type I migration Our analysis which is complemented by numerical simulations recovers characteristics already noted by numericists namely that the viscous timescale across the horseshoe region must be shorter than the libration time in order to avoid saturation and that
provided this condition is satisfied the entropy related part of the horseshoe drag remains large if the thermal timescale is shorter than the libration time Side results include a study of the Lindblad torque as a function of thermal diffusivity and a contribution to the corotation torque arising from vortensity viscously created at the contact discontinuities that appear at the horseshoe separatrices
The recent development of a new minimum mass solar nebula under the assumption that the giant planets formed in the compact configuration of the Nice model has shed new light on planet formation in the solar system Desch previously found that a steady state protoplanetary disk with an outer boundary truncated by photoevaporation by an external massive star would have a steep surface density profile
In a completely novel way we have adapted numerical methods for solving propagating phase change problems to astrophysical disks We find that a one-dimensional time-dependent disk model that self-consistently tracks the location of the outer boundary produces shallower profiles than those predicted for a steady state disk The resulting surface density profiles have a radial dependence of Sigma(r) \alpha r^(-1
The evolutionary timescales of the model disks can be sped up or slowed down by altering the amount of far-ultraviolet flux or the viscosity parameter alpha Slowing the evolutionary timescale by decreasing the incident far ultraviolet flux or similarly by decreasing alpha can help to grow planets more rapidly but at the cost of decreased migration timescales
Although they similarly affect relevant timescales changes in the far ultraviolet flux or alpha produce disks with drastically different outer radii Despite their differences these disks are all characterized by outward mass transport mass loss at the outer edge and a truncated outer boundary The transport of mass from small to large radii can potentially prevent the rapid inward migration of Jupiter and Saturn
Starting from the present version of the Riga dynamo experiment with its rotating magnetic eigenfield dominated by a single frequency we ask for those modifications of this set-up that would allow for a non-trivial magnetic field behaviour in the saturation regime Assuming an increased ratio of azimuthal to axial flow velocity
we obtain energy oscillations with a frequency below the eigenfrequency of the magnetic field These new oscillations are identified as magneto-inertial waves that result from a slight imbalance of Lorentz and inertial forces Increasing the azimuthal velocity further or increasing the total magnetic Reynolds number we find transitions to a chaotic behaviour of the dynamo
Radial-velocity planet search campaigns are now beginning to detect low-mass &#34;Super-Earth&#34; planets with minimum masses M sin i &lt; 10 M_earth Using two independently-developed methods we have derived detection limits from nearly four years of the highest-precision data on 24 bright stable stars from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search Both methods are more conservative than a human analysing an individual observed data set
as is demonstrated by the fact that both techniques would detect the radial velocity signals announced as exoplanets for the 61 Vir system in 50% of trials There are modest differences between the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria that they adopt What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection process such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about planetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set
Averaging over all 24 stars in the period range P&lt;300 days and the eccentricity range 0 0&lt;e&lt;0 6 we could have detected 99% of planets with velocity amplitudes K&gt;7 1 m/s For the best stars in the sample we are able to detect or exclude planets with K&gt;3 m/s corresponding to minimum masses of 8 M_earth (P=5 days) or 17 M_earth (P=50 days)
The tidal evolution of hot Jupiters may change the efficiency of transit surveys of stellar clusters The orbital decay that hot Jupiters suffer may result in their destruction leaving fewer transiting planets in older clusters We calculate the impact tidal evolution has for different assumed stellar populations including that of 47~Tuc
a globular cluster that was the focus of an intense HST search for transits We find that in older clusters one expects to detect fewer transiting planets by a factor of two for surveys sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0 5~AU and up to a factor of 25 for surveys sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0
Additionally tidal evolution affects the distribution of transiting planets as a function of semi-major axis producing larger orbital period gaps for transiting planets as the age of the cluster increases Tidal evolution can explain the lack of detected exoplanets in 47~Tuc without invoking other mechanisms Four open clusters residing within the {\em Kepler} fields of view have ages that span 0
it will provide key tests for our tidal evolution hypothesis Finally our results suggest that observers wishing to discover transiting planets in clusters must have sufficient accuracy to detect lower mass planets search larger numbers of cluster members or have longer observation windows to be confident that a significant number of transits will occur for a population of stars
Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a &#34;blend&#34; rather than a planet orbiting a star
A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c) showing transit timing variations
and an additional shallower signal with a 1 59-day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature For the shallower signal we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits
The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9d) in a multiple system rather than a false positive
We report observations of HD 80606 using the 10 4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the OSIRIS tunable filter imager We acquired very-high-precision narrow-band photometry in four bandpasses around the K I absorption feature during the January 2010 transit of HD 80606b and during out-of-transit observations conducted in January and April of 2010
We obtained differential photometric precisions of \sim 2 08e-4 for the in-transit flux ratio measured at 769 91-nm which probes the K I line core We find no significant difference in the in-transit flux ratio between observations at 768 76 and 769 91 nm Yet we find a difference of \sim 8
While the presence of red noise in the transit data has a non-negligible effect on the uncertainties in the flux ratio the 777 36-769 91 nm colour during transit shows no effects from red noise and also indicates a significant colour change with a mean value of \sim 8 99\pm0
This large change in the colour is equivalent to a \sim 4 2% change in the apparent planetary radius with wavelength which is much larger than the atmospheric scale height This implies the observations probed the atmosphere at very low pressures as well as a dramatic change in the pressure at which the slant optical depth reaches unity between \sim770 and 777 nm
We hypothesize that the excess absorption may be due to K I in a high-speed wind being driven from the exoplanet&#39;s exosphere We discuss the viability of this and alternative interpretations including stellar limb darkening starspots and effects from Earth&#39;s atmosphere We strongly encourage follow-up observations of HD 80606b to confirm the signal measured here
The search for a habitable extrasolar planet has long interested scientists but only recently have the tools become available to search for such planets In the past decades the number of known extrasolar planets has ballooned into the hundreds and with it the expectation that the discovery of the first Earth-like extrasolar planet is not far off
Here we develop a novel metric of habitability for discovered planets and use this to arrive at a prediction for when the first habitable planet will be discovered Using a bootstrap analysis of currently discovered exoplanets we predict the discovery of the first Earth-like planet to be announced in the first half of 2011
with the likeliest date being early May 2011 Our predictions using only the properties of previously discovered exoplanets accord well with external estimates for the discovery of the first potentially habitable extrasolar planet and highlights the the usefulness of predictive scientometric techniques to understand the pace of scientific discovery in many fields
&#34;Propellers&#34; in planetary rings are disturbances in ring material excited by moonlets that open only partial gaps We describe a new type of co-orbital resonance that can explain the observed non-Keplerian motions of propellers The resonance is between the moonlet underlying the propeller and co-orbiting ring particles downstream of the moonlet where the gap closes
The moonlet librates within the gap about an equilibrium point established by co-orbiting material and stabilized by the Coriolis force In the limit of small libration amplitude the libration period scales linearly with the gap azimuthal width and inversely as the square root of the co-orbital mass The new resonance recalls but is distinct from conventional horseshoe and tadpole orbits; we call it the &#34;frog&#34; resonance
after the relevant term in equine hoof anatomy For a ring surface density and gap geometry appropriate for the propeller Blériot in Saturn&#39;s A ring our theory predicts a libration period of ~4 years similar to the ~3 7 year period over which Blériot&#39;s orbital longitude is observed to vary
We modeled the 3-D structure of the Kuiper Belt dust cloud at four different dust production rates incorporating both planet-dust interactions and grain-grain collisions using the collisional grooming algorithm Simulated images of a model with a face-on optical depth of ~10^-4 primarily show an azimuthally-symmetric ring at 40-47 AU in submillimeter and infrared wavelengths; this ring is associated with the cold classical Kuiper Belt
For models with lower optical depths (10^-6 and 10^-7) synthetic infrared images show that the ring widens and a gap opens in the ring at the location of of Neptune; this feature is caused by trapping of dust grains in Neptune&#39;s mean motion resonances At low optical depths a secondary ring also appears associated with the hole cleared in the center of the disk by Saturn
Our simulations which incorporate 25 different grain sizes illustrate that grain-grain collisions are important in sculpting today&#39;s Kuiper Belt dust and probably other aspects of the Solar System dust complex; collisions erase all signs of azimuthal asymmetry from the submillimeter image of the disk at every dust level we considered
Our Sun like all stars formed within a cold molecular cloud Astronomical observations and theory provide considerable detail into this process Yet cosmochemical observations of short lived radionuclides in primitive meteorites in particular 60Fe provide unequivocal evidence that the early solar system inherited fresh nucleosynthetic material from the core of a hot
massive star almost certainly ejected in a supernova explosion I give a short introduction to the fields of star formation and meteoritics and discuss how the reconciliation of their disparate clues to our origin places strong constraints on the environment of the Solar birthplace Direct injection of supernova ejecta into a protoplanetary disk or a dense molecular core is unlikely since their small sizes require placement unusually close to the massive star
Following up our recent analysis devoted to the impact of non steady accretion on the location of young low-mass stars or brown dwarfs in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram we perform a detailed analysis devoted to the effect of burst accretion on the internal structure of low-mass and solar type stars We find that episodic accretion can produce objects with significantly higher central temperatures than the ones of the non accreting counterparts of same mass and age
As a consequence lithium depletion can be severely enhanced in these objects This provides a natural explanation for the unexpected level of lithium depletion observed in young objects for the inferred age of their parent cluster These results confirm the limited reliability of lithium abundance as a criterion for assessing or rejecting cluster membership
They also show that lithium is not a reliable age indicator because its fate strongly depends on the past accretion history of the star Under the assumption that giant planets primarily form in massive disks prone to gravitational instability and thus to accretion burst episodes the same analysis also explains the higher Li depletion observed in planet hosting stars
At last we show that depending on the burst rate and intensity accretion outbursts can produce solar mass stars with lower convective envelope masses at ages less than a few tens of Myr than predicted by standard (non or slowly accreting) pre-main sequence models This result has interesting although speculative
We use the current orbital structure of large (&gt;50km) asteroids in the main asteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when they migrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones Minton &amp; Malhotra (2009) showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt can be reproduced by an exponentially-decaying migration of the giant planets on a time scale of tau ~ 0
However self-consistent numerical simulations show that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is inconsistent with an exponential change in their semi major axes on such a short time scale (Hahn &amp; Malhotra 1999) In fact the typical time scale is tau &gt; 5My When giant planet migration on this time scale is applied to the asteroid belt
the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the observed one However the planet migration can be significantly sped up by planet-planet encounters Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn have close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune themselves) and where this third planet after being scattered inwards by Saturn
is scattered outwards by Jupiter This scenario leads to a very rapid increase in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn that we show here to have only mild effects on the structure of asteroid belt This type of evolution is called a jumping-Jupiter case Our results suggest that the total mass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration were comparable to those currently observed
We report the discovery of two new transiting extrasolar planets HAT-P-18b orbits the V=12 759 K2 dwarf star GSC 2594-00646 with a period P=5 508023+-0 000006 d transit epoch Tc=2454715 02174+-0 00020 (BJD) and transit duration 0 1131+-0 0009 d The host star has a mass of 0 77+-0 03 Msun
radius of 0 75+-0 04 Rsun effective temperature 4803+-80 K and metallicity [Fe/H]=+0 10+-0 08 The planetary companion has a mass of 0 197+-0 013 Mjup and radius of 0 995+-0 052 Rjup yielding a mean density of 0 25+-0 04 g cm-3 HAT-P-19b orbits the V=12 901 K1 dwarf star GSC 2283-00589
with a period P=4 008778+-0 000006 d transit epoch Tc=2455091 53417+-0 00034 (BJD) and transit duration 0 1182+-0 0014 d The host star has a mass of 0 84+-0 04 Msun radius of 0 82+-0 05 Rsun effective temperature 4990+-130 K and metallicity [Fe/H]=+0 23+-0 08 The planetary companion has a mass of 0
and radius of 1 132+-0 072 Rjup yielding a mean density of 0 25+-0 04 g cm-3 The radial velocity residuals for HAT-P-19 exhibit a linear trend in time which indicates the presence of a third body in the system Comparing these observations with theoretical models we find that HAT-P-18b and HAT-P-19b are each consistent with a hydrogen-helium dominated gas giant planet with negligible core mass
HAT-P-18b and HAT-P-19b join HAT-P-12b and WASP-21b in an emerging group of low-density Saturn-mass planets with negligible inferred core masses However unlike HAT-P-12b and WASP-21b both HAT-P-18b and HAT-P-19b orbit stars with super-solar metallicity This calls into question the heretofore suggestive correlation between the inferred core mass and host star metallicity for Saturn-mass planets
We have carried out a continuous multi-band photometric monitoring of the nuclear activity of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 from 2008 to 2010 Our main aim has been to study the outburst mechanism on the basis of a follow-up of the photometric variations associated with the release of dust We used a standardized method to obtain the 10 arc-sec nucleus photometry in the V
R and I filters of the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system being accurately calibrated with standard Landolt stars Production of dust in the R and I bands during the 2010 Feb 3 outburst has been also computed We conclude that the massive ejection of large (optically-thin) particles from the surface at the time of the outburst is the triggering mechanism to produce the outburst
Ulterior sublimation of these ice-rich dust particles during the following days induces fragmentation generating micrometer-sized grains that increase the dust spatial density to produce the outburst in the optical range due to scattering of sun light The material leaving the nucleus adopts a fan-like dust feature formed by micrometer-sized particles that are decaying in brightness as it evolved outwards
By analyzing the photometric signal measured in a standardized 10-arcsec aperture using the Phase Dispersion Minimization technique we have found a clear periodicity of 50 days Remarkably this value is also consistent with an outburst frequency of 7 4 outbursts/year deduced from the number of outbursts noticed during the effective observing time
We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project Using the stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog we have separated the sample into 129 000 dwarfs and 17 000 giants and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A
F G K and M Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public dataset (30 minute sampling and 33 5 day baseline) we have explored the variability of the stellar sample The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25% for the entire sample but can reach 100% for the brightest groups of stars in the sample
G-dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of $\sigma \sim 0 04$ mmag At the precision of Kepler $&gt;95$% of the giant stars are variable with a noise floor of $\sim 0 1$ mmag 0 3 mmag and 10 mmag for the G-giants K-giants and M-giants
respectively The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically-derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K-giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of dataset baseline (1 - 33 days)
at the native 30-minute sampling of the public Kepler data To within the limitations of the data we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the dataset baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days in particular for the most variable stars The lower mass M-dwarf K-dwarf G-dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F-dwarf and A-dwarf stars as the time-baseline is increased
The existence of extremely wide binaries in the low-inclination component of the Kuiper Belt provides a unique handle on the dynamical history of this population Some popular frameworks of the formation of the Kuiper Belt suggest that planetesimals were moved there from lower semi-major axis orbits by scattering encounters with Neptune
We test the effects such events would have on binary systems and find that wide binaries are efficiently destroyed by the kinds of scattering events required to create the Kuiper Belt with this mechanism This indicates that a binary-bearing component of the cold Kuiper Belt was emplaced through a gentler mechanism or was formed in situ
Cosmic collisions on planets cause detectable optical flashes that range from terrestrial shooting stars to bright fireballs On June 3 2010 a bolide in Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere was simultaneously observed from the Earth by two amateur astronomers observing Jupiter in red and blue wavelengths The bolide appeared as a flash of 2 s duration in video recording data of the planet
The analysis of the light curve of the observations results in an estimated energy of the impact of 0 9-4 0x10^{15} J which corresponds to a colliding body of 8-13 m diameter assuming a mean density of 2 g cm^{-3} Images acquired a few days later by the Hubble Space Telescope and other large ground-based facilities did not show any signature of aerosol debris
temperature or chemical composition anomaly confirming that the body was small and destroyed in Jupiter&#39;s upper atmosphere Several collisions of this size may happen on Jupiter on a yearly basis A systematic study of the impact rate and size of these bolides can enable an empirical determination of the flux of meteoroids in Jupiter with implications for the populations of small bodies in the outer Solar System and may allow a better quantification of the threat of impacting bodies to Earth
We present ground-based high resolution N-band spectra (\Delta v = 15 km/s) of pure rotational lines of water vapor in two protoplanetary disks surrounding the pre-main sequence stars AS 205N and RNO 90 selected based on detections of rotational water lines by the Spitzer IRS Using VISIR on the Very Large Telescope
we spectrally resolve individual lines and show that they have widths of 30-60 km/s consistent with an origin in Keplerian disks at radii of ~1 AU The water lines have similar widths to those of the CO at 4 67 micron indicating that the mid-infrared water lines trace similar radii
The rotational temperatures of the water are 540 and 600K in the two disks respectively However the lines ratios show evidence of non-LTE excitation with low-excitation line fluxes being over-predicted by 2-dimensional disk LTE models Due to the limited number of observed lines and the non-LTE line ratios an accurate measure of the water ortho/para ratio is not available
but a best estimate for AS 205N is ortho/para = 4 5 +/- 1 0 apparently ruling out a low-temperature origin of the water The spectra demonstrate that high resolution spectroscopy of rotational water lines is feasible from the ground and further that ground-based high resolution spectroscopy is likely to significantly improve our understanding of the inner disk chemistry recently revealed by recent Spitzer observations
The radial velocity signature of stellar noise is small around the meter-per-second but already too much for the detection of Earth mass planets in habitable zones In this paper we address the important role played by observational strategies in averaging out the radial velocity signature of stellar noise We also derive the planetary mass detection limits expected in presence of stellar noise
We start with HARPS asteroseismology measurements for 4 stars (beta Hyi alpha Cen A mu Ara and tau Ceti) available in the ESO archive plus very precise measurements of alpha Cen B This sample covers different spectral types from G2 to K1 and different evolutionary stage from subgiant to dwarf stars
Since the span of our data ranges between 5 to 8 days we will have access to oscillation modes and granulation phenomena without important contribution of activity noise which is present at larger time scales For those 5 stars we generate synthetic radial velocity measurements after fitting corresponding models of stellar noise in Fourier space
These measurements allows us to study the radial velocity variation due to stellar noise for different observational strategies as well as the corresponding planetary mass detection limits Applying 3 measurements per night of 10 minutes exposure each 2 hours apart seems to average out most efficiently the stellar noise considered
For quiet K1V stars as alpha Cen B such a strategy allows us to detect planets of ~3 times the mass of Earth with an orbital period of 200 days corresponding to the habitable zone of the star Since activity is not yet included in our simulation these detection limits correspond to a case
The peculiar object P/2010 A2 was discovered by the LINEAR near-Earth asteroid survey in January 2010 and given a cometary designation due to the presence of a trail of material although there was no central condensation or coma The appearance of this object in an asteroidal orbit (small eccentricity and inclination) in the inner main asteroid belt attracted attention as a potential new member of the recently recognized class of &#39;Main Belt Comets&#39; (MBCs)
If confirmed this new object would greatly expand the range in heliocentric distance over which MBCs are found Here we present observations taken from the unique viewing geometry provided by ESA&#39;s Rosetta spacecraft far from the Earth that demonstrate that the trail is due to a single event rather than a period of cometary activity
in agreement with independent results from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) The trail is made up of relatively large particles of millimetre to centimetre size that remain close to the parent asteroid The shape of the trail can be explained by an initial impact ejecting large clumps of debris that disintegrated and dispersed almost immediately
Up to now planet search programs have concentrated on main sequence stars later than spectral type F5 However identifying planets of early type stars would be interesting For example the mass loss of planets orbiting early and late type stars is different because of the differences of the EUV and X-ray radiation of the host stars
The rotation states of kilometer sized near earth asteroids are known to be affected by the YORP effect In a related effect Binary YORP (BYORP) the orbital properties of a binary asteroid evolves under a radiation effect mostly acting on a tidally locked secondary The BYORP effect can alter the orbital elements in $\sim 10^{4-5}$ years for a $D_{p}=2\;km$ primary with a $D_{s}=0
It can either separate the binary components or cause them to collide In this paper we devise a simple approach to calculate the YORP effect on asteroids and BYORP effect on binaries including $J_2$ effects due to primary oblateness and the sun We apply this to asteroids with known shapes as well as a set of randomly generated bodies with various degrees of smoothness
We find a strong correlation between the strengths of an asteroid&#39;s YORP and BYORP effects Therefore a statistical knowledge on one could be used to estimate the effect of the other We show that the action of BYORP preferentially shrinks rather than expands the binary orbit and that YORP preferentially slows down asteroids
This conclusion holds for the two extremes of thermal conductivities studied in this work and assuming the asteroid reaches a stable point but may break down for moderate thermal conductivity The YORP and BYORP effects are shown to be smaller than what could be naively expected due to near cancellation of the effects on small scales
Taking this near cancellation into account a simple order of magnitude estimate of the YORP and BYORP effects as function of the sizes and smoothness of the bodies is calculated Finally we provide a simple proof showing that there is no secular effect due to absorption of radiation in BYORP
Transiting exoplanets (TEPs) observed just about 10 Myrs after formation of their host systems may serve as the Rosetta Stone for planet formation theories They would give strong constraints on several aspects of planet formation e g time-scales (planet formation would then be possible within 10 Myrs) the radius of the planet could indicate whether planets form by gravitational collapse (being larger when young) or accretion growth (being smaller when young)
The CoRoT exoplanet science team announces the discovery of CoRoT-11b a fairly massive hot-Jupiter transiting a V=12 9 mag F6 dwarf star (M*=1 27 +/- 0 05 Msun R*=1 37 +/- 0 03 Rsun Teff=6440 +/- 120 K) with an orbital period of P=2 994329 +/- 0 000011 days and semi-major axis a=0
The detection of part of the radial velocity anomaly caused by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect shows that the transit-like events detected by CoRoT are caused by a planet-sized transiting object in a prograde orbit The relatively high projected rotational velocity of the star (vsini=40+/-5 km/s) places CoRoT-11 among the most rapidly rotating planet host stars discovered so far
Understanding the consequences of the gravitational interaction between a star and a planet is fundamental to the study of exoplanets The solution of the two-body problem shows that the planet moves in an elliptical path around the star and that each body moves in an ellipse about the common center of mass
We present time series measurements of chromospheric activity for more than 2600 main sequence and subgiant stars on the California Planet Search (CPS) program with spectral types ranging from about F5V to M4V for main sequence stars and from G0IV to about K5IV for subgiants The large data set of more than 44
We define $\Delta S$ as an excess in emission in the Ca II H\&amp;K lines above the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as a function of $\Delta S$ and \bv\ for main sequence and subgiant stars Although the jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level
we find that K dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter The lack of correlation between observed jitter and chromospheric activity in K dwarfs suggests that the observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and not astrophysical noise sources Thus given the long-term precision for the CPS program
radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise for chromospherically quiet K dwarf stars making these stars particularly well-suited for the highest precision Doppler surveys Chromospherically quiet F and G dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysical jitter than K dwarfs Despite the fact that the \rms\ in Doppler velocities is correlated with the mean chromospheric activity
The influence of optical scattering and thermal radiation models an the Yarkovsky-O&#39;Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect is studied Lambertian formulation is compared with Hapke scattering and emission laws and Lommel-Seeliger reflection Although the form of reflectivity function strongly influences mean torques due to scattering or thermal radiation alone their combined contribution to the rotation period YORP is not much different from the standard Lambertian values
We explore the transmission spectrum of the Neptune-class exoplanet GJ 436b including the possibility that its atmospheric opacity is dominated by a variety of non- equilibrium chemical products We also validate our transmission code by demonstrating close agreement with analytic models that use only Rayleigh scattering or water vapor opacity
We find broad disagreement with radius variations predicted by another published model For GJ 436b the relative coolness of the planet&#39;s atmosphere along with its implied high metallicity may make it dissimilar in character compared to &#34;hot Jupiters &#34; Some recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative abundances of H2O and CH4 present in GJ 436b&#39;s atmosphere
compared to calculations from equilibrium chemistry We include these characteristics in our models and examine the effects of absorption from methane-derived higher order hydrocarbons Significant absorption from HCN and C2H2 are found throughout the infrared while C2H4 and C2H6 are less easily seen We perform detailed simulations of JWST observations
including all likely noise sources and find that we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes from this planet&#39;s transmission spectrum For instance the width of the features at 1 5 3 3 and 7 microns indicates the amount of HCN versus C2H2 present The NIRSpec prism mode will be useful due to its large spectral range and the relatively large number of photo-electrons recorded per spectral resolution element
However extremely bright host stars like GJ 436 may be better observed with a higher spectroscopic resolution mode in order to avoid detector saturation We find that observations with the MIRI low resolution spectrograph should also have high signal-to-noise in the 5 - 10 micron range due to the brightness of the star and the relatively low spectral resolution (R ~ 100) of this mode
Context Grains in circumstellar disks are believed to grow by mutual collisions and subsequent sticking due to surface forces Results of many fields of research involving circumstellar disks such as radiative transfer calculations disk chemistry magneto-hydrodynamic simulations largely depend on the unknown grain size distribution <br>Aims As detailed calculations of grain growth and fragmentation are both numerically challenging and computationally expensive
we aim to find simple recipes and analytical solutions for the grain size distribution in circumstellar disks for a scenario in which grain growth is limited by fragmentation and radial drift can be neglected <br>Methods We generalize previous analytical work on self-similar steady-state grain distributions Numerical simulations are carried out to identify under which conditions the grain size distributions can be understood in terms of a combination of power-law distributions
A physically motivated fitting formula for grain size distributions is derived using our analytical predictions and numerical simulations <br>Results We find good agreement between analytical results and numerical solutions of the Smoluchowski equation for simple shapes of the kernel function The results for more complicated and realistic cases can be fitted with a physically motivated &#34;black box&#34; recipe presented in this paper
We study the dynamics of large dust grains &gt;1 micron with orbits outside of the heliosphere (beyond 250 AU) Motion of the Solar System through the interstellar medium (ISM) at a velocity of 26 km/s subjects these particles to gas and Coulomb drag (grains are expected to be photoelectrically charged) as well as the Lorentz force and the electric force caused by the induction electric field
We show that to zeroth order the combined effect of these forces can be well described in the framework of the classical Stark problem particle motion in a Keplerian potential subject to an additional constant force Based on this analogy we elucidate the circumstances in which the motion becomes unbound
and show that under local ISM conditions dust grains smaller than ~100 microns originating in the Oort Cloud (e g in collisions of comets) beyond 10000 AU are ejected from the Solar System under the action of the electric force Orbital motion of larger bound grains is described analytically using the orbit-averaged Hamiltonian approach and consists of orbital plane precession at a fixed semi-major axis
accompanied by the periodic variations of the inclination and eccentricity (the latter may approach unity in some cases) A more detailed analysis of the combined effect of gas and Coulomb drag shows it is possible to reduce particle semi-major axes but that the degree of orbital decay is limited (a factor of several at best) by passages through atomic and molecular clouds
The Palomar High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES) monitored 51 subarcsecond binary systems to evaluate whether tertiary companions as small as Jovian planets orbited either the primary or secondary stars perturbing their otherwise smooth Keplerian motions Twenty-one of those systems were observed 10 or more times and show no evidence of additional companions
The two current models for giant planet formation are core accretion and disk instability We discuss the core masses and overall planetary enrichment in heavy elements predicted by the two formation models and show that both models could lead to a large range of final compositions For example both can form giant planets with nearly stellar compositions
We examine the first phase of the core accretion model namely the dust growth/fragmentation in binary systems In our model a gas and dust disk is present around the primary star and is perturbed by the secondary We study the effects of a secondary with/without eccentricity on the dust population to determine what sizes the aggregates can reach and how that compares to the dust population in disks around single stars
<br>We find that the secondary star has two effects on the dust population 1 ) The disk is truncated due to the presence of the secondary star and the maximum mass of the particles is decreased in the lowered gas densities This effect is dominant in the outer disk 2
) The perturbation of the secondary pumps up the eccentricity of the gas disk which in turn increases the relative velocity between the dust and the gas Therefore the maximum particle sizes are further decreased The second effect of the secondary influences the entire disk Coagulation is efficiently reduced even at the very inner parts of the disk
We elucidate the interplay between Newtonian thermal relaxation and numerical dissipation of several different origins in flow simulations of hot extrasolar planet atmospheres Currently a large range of Newtonian relaxation or &#34;cooling&#34; times (~10 days to ~1 hour) is used among different models and within a single model over the model domain
In this study we demonstrate that a short relaxation time (much less than the planetary rotation time) leads to a large amount of unphysical grid-scale oscillations that contaminate the flow field These oscillations force the use of an excessive amount of artificial viscosity to quench them and prevent the simulation from &#34;blowing up&#34;
Even if the blow-up is prevented such simulations can be highly inaccurate because they are either severely over-dissipated or under-dissipated and are best discarded in these cases Other numerical stability and timestep size enhancers (e g Robert-Asselin filter or semi-implicit time-marching schemes) also produce similar but less excessive damping We present diagnostics procedures to choose the &#34;optimal&#34; simulation and discuss implications of our findings for modeling hot extrasolar planet atmospheres
It has been suggested that chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) were formed at the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk and then entrained in magnetocentrifugal X-winds We study trajectories of such solid bodies with the consideration of the central star gravity the protoplanetary disk gravity and the gas drag of the wind
The efficiency of the gas drag depends on a parameter $\eta$ which is the product of the solid body size and density We find that the gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a non-negligible effect on the trajectories If a solid body re-enters the flared disk the re-entering radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment
the disk&#39;s gravity the parameter $\eta$ and the initial launching angle The disk&#39;s gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30% We find a threshold $\eta$ denoted as $\eta_t$ for any particular configuration of the X-wind below which the solid bodies will be expelled from the planetary system
$\eta_t$ sensitively depends on the initial launching angle and also depends on the mass of the disk Only the solid bodies with a $\eta$ larger than but very close to $\eta_t$ can be launched to a re-entering radius larger than 1 AU This size-sorting effect may explain why chondrules come with a narrow range of sizes within each chondritic class
We present spectra of Eris from the MMT 6 5 meter telescope and Red Channel Spectrograph (5700-9800 angstroms; 5 angstroms per pix) on Mt Hopkins AZ and of Pluto from the Steward Observatory 2 3 meter telescope and Boller and Chivens spectrograph (7100-9400 angstroms; 2 angstroms per pix) on Kitt Peak
AZ In addition we present laboratory transmission spectra of methane-nitrogen and methane-argon ice mixtures By anchoring our analysis in methane and nitrogen solubilities in one another as expressed in the phase diagram of Prokhvatilov and Yantsevich (1983) and comparing methane bands in our Eris and Pluto spectra and methane bands in our laboratory spectra of methane and nitrogen ice mixtures
we find Eris&#39; bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are about 10% and about 90% and Pluto&#39;s bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are about 3% and about 97% Such abundances for Pluto are consistent with values reported in the literature It appears that the bulk volatile composition of Eris is similar to the bulk volatile composition of Pluto
Both objects appear to be dominated by nitrogen ice Our analysis also suggests unlike previous work reported in the literature that the methane and nitrogen stoichiometry is constant with depth into the surface of Eris Finally we point out that our Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of 40% methane and 60% argon
Brown Dwarf and extrasolar planet atmospheres form clouds which strongly influence the local chemistry and physics These clouds are globally neutral obeying dust-gas charge equilibrium which is on short time scales inconsistent with the observation of stochastic ionisation events of the solar system planets We argue that a significant volume of the clouds in Brown Dwarfs and extrasolar planets is susceptible to local discharge events
These are electron avalanches triggered by charged dust grains Such intra-cloud discharges occur on time scales shorter than the time needed to neutralise the dust grains by collisional processes An ensemble of discharges is likely to produce enough free charges to suggest a partial and stochastic coupling of the atmosphere to a large-scale magnetic field
In order to explain the main characteristics of the observed population of extrasolar planets and the giant planets in the Solar System we need to get a clear understanding of which are the initial conditions that allowed their formation To this end we develop a semi-analytical model for computing planetary systems formation based on the core instability model for the gas accretion of the embryos and the oligarchic growth regime for the accretion of the solid cores
With this model we explore not only different initial discs profiles motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion discs but we also consider different initial conditions to generate a variety of planetary systems assuming a large range of discs masses and sizes according to the last results in protoplanetary discs observations
We form a large population of planetary systems in order to explore the effects in the formation of assuming different discs and also the effects of type I and II regimes of planetary migration which were found to play fundamental role in reproducing the distribution of observed exoplanets Our results show that the observed population of exoplanets and the giant planets in the Solar System are well represented when considering a surface density profile with a power law in the inner part characterized by an exponent of -1
We have numerically studied the thermal evolution of various-mass terrestrial planets in habitable zones focusing on duration of dynamo activity to generate their intrinsic magnetic fields which may be one of key factors in habitability on the planets In particular we are concerned with super-Earths observations of which are rapidly developing
We calculated evolution of temperature distributions in planetary interior using Vinet equations of state Arrhenius-type formula for mantle viscosity and the astrophysical mixing length theory for convective heat transfer modified for mantle convection After calibrating the model with terrestrial planets in the Solar system we apply it for 0 1--$10M_{\oplus}$ rocky planets with surface temperature of $300~\mbox{K}$ (in habitable zones) and the Earth-like compositions
With the criterion for heat flux at the CMB (core-mantle boundary) the lifetime of the magnetic fields is evaluated from the calculated thermal evolution We found that the lifetime slowly increases with the planetary mass ($M_p$) independent of initial temperature gap at the core-mantle boundary ($\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$) but beyond a critical value $M_{c
p}$ ($\sim O(1)M_{\oplus}$) it abruptly declines by the mantle viscosity enhancement due to the pressure effect We derived $M_{c p}$ as a function of $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$ and a rheological parameter (activation volume $V^*$) Thus the magnetic field lifetime of super-Earths with $M_p &gt; M_{p c}$ sensitively depends on $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$
The Monte Carlo method of the nominal orbit clonning was applied to the case of 99942 Apophis the asteroid from the Aten group Calculations based on observations from the time interval of 2004 03 15 - 2008 01 09 have shown that the asteroid will pass near Earth in 2029 at the minimum distance of 5
what implies that the likelihood that Apophis strikes the planet at 2036 April 13 increased to 4 5\times 10^{-6} (from about 6\times 10^{-7} previously announced by us in Paper~I (Krolikowska Sitarski and Soltan 2009 MNRAS 399 1964) This value is identical with that given by Chesley Baer and Monet (2010
We present high-resolution computer simulations of dust dynamics and planetesimal formation in turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability We show that the turbulent viscosity associated with magnetorotational turbulence in a non-stratified shearing box increases when going from 256^3 to 512^3 grid points in the presence of a weak imposed magnetic field
yielding a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha\approx0 003$ at high resolution Particles representing approximately meter-sized boulders concentrate in large-scale high-pressure regions in the simulation box The appearance of zonal flows and particle concentration in pressure bumps is relatively similar at moderate (256^3) and high (512^3) resolution In the moderate-resolution simulation we activate particle self-gravity at a time when there is little particle concentration
in contrast with previous simulations where particle self-gravity was activated during a concentration event We observe that bound clumps form over the next ten orbits with initial birth masses of a few times the dwarf planet Ceres At high resolution we activate self-gravity during a particle concentration event leading to a burst of planetesimal formation
with clump masses ranging from a significant fraction of to several times the mass of Ceres We present a new domain decomposition algorithm for particle-mesh schemes Particles are spread evenly among the processors and the local gas velocity field and assigned drag forces are exchanged between a domain-decomposed mesh and discrete blocks of particles
The asteroid (3200) Phaethon is widely recognized as the parent of the Geminid meteoroid stream However it has never shown evidence for on-going mass loss or for any form of comet-like activity that would indicate the continued replenishment of the stream Following an alert by Battams and Watson (2009) we used NASA&#39;s STEREO-A spacecraft to image Phaethon near perihelion
in the period UT 2009 June 17 - 22 when the heliocentric distance was near 0 14 AU The resulting photometry shows an unexpected brightening by a factor of two starting UT 2009 June 20 2+/-0 2 which we interpret as an impulsive release of dust particles from Phaethon If the density is near 2500 kg/m^3
then the emitted dust particles must have a combined mass of ~2 5x10^8 a1 kg where a1 is the particle radius in millimeters Assuming a1 = 1 this is approximately 10^-4 of the Geminid stream mass and to replenish the stream in steady-state within its estimated ~1000 yr lifetime would require ~10 events like the one observed
per orbit Alternatively on-going mass loss may be unrelated to the event which produced the Phaethon-Geminid complex An impact origin of the dust is highly unlikely Phaethon is too hot for water ice to survive rendering unlikely the possibility that dust is ejected through gas-drag from sublimated ice Instead we suggest that Phaethon is essentially a rock comet
Injection of material from a core-collapse supernova into the solar system&#39;s already-formed disk is one proposed mechanism for producing the short-lived radionuclides such as 26Al and 41Ca inferred from isotopic studies of meteorites to have existed in the solar nebula This hypothesis has recently been challenged on the basis that the injection of enough supernova material to match the meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca would produce large
measureable and unobserved collateral effects on oxygen isotopes Here we calculate again the shifts in oxygen isotopes due to injection of supernova material in the solar nebula using a variety of nucleosynthetic conditions of our own progenitor explosions Unlike previous studies of this type we also consider the effect of non-homogeneity in abundance distribution of the nucleosynthesis products after the explosion
We calculate the shifts in oxygen isotopes due to injection of sufficient supernova material to produce the meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca and analyze the predicted shifts in detail for compatibility with meteoritic data We find that the range in possible isotopic shifts is considerable and sensitive to parameters such as progenitor mass and anisotropy of the explosion; however
a small number of compatible scenarios do exist Because of the wide range of outcomes and the sensitivity of isotopic yields to assumed conditions it is difficult to constrain the supernova that may have led to injection of 26Al in the solar nebula Conversely we argue that the existence of viable counterexamples demonstrates that it is premature to use oxygen isotopes to rule out injection of 26Al and 41Ca into the solar nebula protoplanetary disk by a nearby supernova
Serendipitous stellar occultation search is so far the only way to detect the existence of very small very dim remote objects in the solar system To date however there are only very few reported detections for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in optical bands In the X-ray band with the RXTE/PCA data of Sco X-1 taken from June 2007 to October 2009
The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b--which has been labelled as a &#39;hot Neptune&#39;--reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of and behind its parent star as seen from Earth Respectively known as the primary transit and secondary eclipse the former constrains the planet&#39;s radius and mass
and the latter constrains the planet&#39;s temperature and with measurements at multiple wavelengths its atmospheric composition Previous work using transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1 4-\mu m water vapour band leaving the planet&#39;s atmospheric composition poorly constrained Here we report the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse
The best-fit compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane (CH4) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for the predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere Moreover we report the presence of some H2O and traces of CO2 Because CH4 is expected to be the dominant carbon-bearing species disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and polymerization of methane into substances such as ethylene may be required to explain the hot Neptune&#39;s small CH4-to-CO ratio
We imaged comet 10P/Tempel 2 on 32 nights from 1999 April through 2000 March R-band lightcurves were obtained on 11 of these nights from 1999 April through 1999 June prior to both the onset of significant coma activity and perihelion Phasing of the data yields a double-peaked lightcurve and indicates a nucleus rotational period of 8
Our data are sufficient to rule out all other possible double-peaked solutions as well as the single- and triple- peaked solutions This rotation period agrees with one of five possible solutions found in post-perihelion data from 1994 by Mueller and Ferrin (1996 Icarus 123 463-477) and unambiguously eliminates their remaining four solutions
We applied our same techniques to published lightcurves from 1988 which were obtained at an equivalent orbital position and viewing geometry as in 1999 We found a rotation period of 8 932 +/- 0 001 hr in 1988 consistent with the findings of previous authors and incompatible with our 1999 solution
Although white dwarfs are believed to be the end point of most stellar evolution unlike main sequence stars they have not yet been the subject of dedicated time-domain surveys for exoplanets We discuss how their size and distinctive colour make them excellent targets for wide-field searches for exoplanets In particular
we note that planets of Earth-size can give rise to multi-magnitude eclipses of massive white dwarfs Such a large signal is almost unmistakable and would be detectable even with very low-precision photometry For objects of smaller size the high accuracy photometry currently being used to detect Super-Earth and smaller planets transiting Sun-sized stars
is capable of revealing minor planets down to R~100km as they transit white dwarfs Such observations can be used to test current evidence for asteroid-size objects being the cause for dust rings which have recently been observed for a number of white dwarfs No other current exoplanet search method is capable of detecting such exo-asteroids
As an initial test of this search strategy we combine synoptic data from the Catalina Sky Survey with multi-colour photometry and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to search ~12 000 white dwarf lightcurves for eclipsing events We find 20 new eclipsing white dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions
Magnetic interactions between a protostar and its accretion disc tend to induce warping in the disc and produce secular changes in the stellar spin direction so that the spin axis may not always be perpendicular to the disc This may help explain the recently observed spin-orbit misalignment in a number of exoplanetary systems
We study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discs under the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internal stresses in the disc including viscous damping of warps and propagation of bending waves We show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with the stellar spin axis the disc evolves towards a warped steady-state on a timescale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagation speed
but in all cases is much shorter than the timescale for the spin evolution (of order of a million years) Moreover for the most likely physical parameters characterizing magnetic protostars circumstellar discs and their interactions the steady-state disc has a rather small warp such that the whole disc lies approximately in a single plane determined by the outer disc boundary conditions
although more extreme parameters may give rise to larger disc warps In agreement with our recent analysis (Lai et al 2010) based on flat discs we find that the back-reaction magnetic torques of the slightly warped disc on the star can either align the stellar spin axis with the disc axis or push it towards misalignment
From CCD observations of a fixed and large star field that contained the binary TNO Orcus we have been able to derive high-precision relative astrometry and photometry of the Orcus system with respect to background stars The RA residuals of an orbital fit to the astrometric data revealed a periodicity of 9
which is what one would expect to be induced by the known Orcus companion The residuals are also correlated with the theoretical positions of the satellite with regard to the primary We therefore have revealed the presence of Orcus&#39; satellite in our astrometric measurements The photocenter motion is much larger than the motion of Orcus around the barycenter
and we show here that detecting some binaries through a carefully devised astrometric technique might be feasible with telescopes of moderate size We also analyzed the system&#39;s mid-term photometry to determine whether the rotation could be tidally locked to the satellite&#39;s orbital period We found that a photometric variability of 9
and is nearly coincident with the orbital period of the satellite We believe this variability might be induced by the satellite&#39;s rotation There is also a slight hint for an additional small variability in the 10 hr range that was already reported in the literature This short-term variability would indicate that the primary is not tidally locked and therefore the system would not have reached a double synchronous state
Implications for the basic physical properties of the primary and its satellite are discussed From angular momentum considerations we suspect that the Orcus satellite might have formed from a rotational fission This requires that the mass of the satellite would be around 0 09 times that of the primary close to the value that one derives by using an albedo of 0
Several photometric surveys for short-period transiting giant planets have targeted a number of open clusters but no convincing detections have been made Although each individual survey typically targeted an insufficient number of stars to expect a detection assuming the frequency of short-period giant planets found in surveys of field stars
we ask whether the lack of detections from the ensemble of open cluster surveys is inconsistent with expectations from the field planet population We select a subset of existing transit surveys with well-defined selection criteria and quantified detection efficiencies and statistically combine their null results to show that the upper limit on the planet fraction is 5
respectively in the $3&lt;P&lt;5$ day period range For the period range of $1&lt;P&lt;3$ days we find upper limits of 1 4% and 0 31% for 1 0 $R_{J}$ and 1 5 $R_{J}$ respectively Comparing these results to the frequency of short-period giant planets around field stars in both radial velocity and transit surveys
Astronomically there are viable mechanisms for distributing organic material throughout the Milky Way Biologically the destructive effects of ultraviolet light and cosmic rays means that the majority of organisms arrive broken and dead on a new world The likelihood of conventional forms of panspermia must therefore be considered low However
Collisional growth of submicron-sized dust grains into macroscopic aggregates is the first step of planet formation in protoplanetary disks These grains are expected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks but its effect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far In this paper
we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust size distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a weakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions To clarify the role of the size distribution we divide our analysis into two steps First we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming a monodisperse (i
e narrow) size distribution We show that the monodisperse growth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is met as is already expected in the previous work Second we numerically simulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski&#39;s method to see how the outcome changes when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve
We find that under certain conditions the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a limited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the dust mass in the system This occurs because remaining small aggregates efficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being strongly charged
(Abridged) The upper atmospheres of close-in gas giant exoplanets are subjected to intense heating/tidal forces from their parent stars Atomic/ionized hydrogen (H) layers are sufficiently rarefied that magnetic pressure may dominate gas pressure for expected planetary magnetic field strength We examine the magnetospheric structure using a 3D isothermal magnetohydrodynamic model that includes
a static &#34;dead zone&#34; near the magnetic equator containing magnetically confined gas; a &#34;wind zone&#34; outside the magnetic equator in which thermal pressure gradients and the magneto-centrifugal-tidal effect give rise to transonic outflow; and a region near the poles where sufficiently strong tidal forces may suppress transonic outflow Using dipole field geometry
we estimate the size of the dead zone to be ~1-10 planetary radii for a range of parameters To understand appropriate base conditions for the 3D isothermal model we compute a 1D thermal model in which photoelectric heating from the stellar Lyman continuum is balanced by collisionally-excited Lyman {\alpha} cooling
This 1D model exhibits a H layer with temperatures T=5000-10000K down to pressures of 10-100 nbar Using the 3D isothermal model we compute H column densities and Lyman {\alpha} transmission spectra for parameters appropriate to HD 209458b Line-integrated transit depths of 5-10% can be achieved for the above base conditions
Strong magnetic fields increase the transit signal while decreasing the mass loss due to higher covering fraction and density of the dead zone In our model most of the transit signal arises from magnetically confined gas some of which may be outside the L1 equipotential Hence the presence of gas outside the L1 equipotential does not directly imply mass loss
We determine an expression for the Type I planet migration torque involving a locally isothermal disk with moderate turbulent viscosity (~0 0005 &lt; alpha &lt; ~0 05) based on three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations The radial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and temperature are assumed to be constant near the planet
We find that the torque is roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial gradients Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are negative Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a smoothed planet potential used to account for the effects of the third dimension do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature gradients on the three-dimensional torque
The results suggest that substantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk opacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is locally isothermal The scalings of the torque and torque density with planet mass and gas sound speed follow the expectations of linear theory
We also determine an improved formula for the torque density distribution that can be used in one-dimensional long-term evolution studies of planets embedded in locally isothermal disks This formula can be also applied in the presence of mildly varying radial gradients and of planets that open gaps We illustrate its use in the case of migrating super-Earths and determine some conditions sufficient for survival
We present the results of BVRI photometry and classification of 53 unusual asteroids including 35 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) 6 high eccentricity/inclination asteroids and 12 recently-identified asteroid-pair candidates Most of these asteroids were not reportedly classified prior to this work For the few asteroids that have been previously studied the results are generally in rough agreement
In addition we merge the results from several photometric/spectroscopic surveys to create a largest-ever sample with 449 spectrally classified NEAs for statistical analysis We identify a &#34;transition point&#34; of the relative number of C/X-like and S-like NEAs at H~18&lt;=&gt;D~1km with confidence level at ~95% or higher We find that the C/X-like
CONTEXT The small radius and high density of CoRoT-7b implies that this transiting planet belongs to a differen t species than all transiting planets previously found Current models suggest that this is the first transiting rocky planet found outside the solar system Given that the planet orbits a solar-like star at a distance of on ly 4
it is expected that material released from its surface may then form an exosphere AIMS We constrai n the properties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit Detecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study the material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet
We scan the entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet focusing particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury and Io in our solar system METHODS Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to be narrow we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT
By subtracting the two spectra from each other we search for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b RESULTS In the first step we focus on Ca I Ca II Na because these lines have been detected in Mercury Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as 300
we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1 6E-18 and 3 2E-18 Wm**-2 For CaO we find an upper limit of E-17 Wm**-2 We also search for emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and derive upper limits for these lines In the whole spectrum we finally try to identify other lines originating in the planet
About 25 per cent of `hot Jupiters&#39; (extrasolar Jovian-mass planets with close-in orbits) are actually orbiting counter to the spin direction of the star Perturbations from a distant binary star companion can produce high inclinations but cannot explain orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum of the system
Such orbits in a stellar context can be produced through secular (that is long term) perturbations in hierarchical triple-star systems Here we report a similar analysis of planetary bodies including both octupole-order effects and tidal friction and find that we can produce hot Jupiters in orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum
With distant stellar mass perturbers such an outcome is not possible With planetary perturbers the inner orbit&#39;s angular momentum component parallel to the total angular momentum need not be constant In fact as we show here it can even change sign leading to a retrograde orbit A brief excursion to very high eccentricity during the chaotic evolution of the inner orbit allows planet-star tidal interactions to rapidly circularize that orbit
Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the initial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks Recently it has been pointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could significantly slow down the coagulation process In this paper we apply the growth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (&#34;frozen&#34; zone) where the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage
For low-turbulence disks we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of the disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star The maximum mass of the aggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer masses at 100 AU
Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the frozen zone but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic aggregates at later stages We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of dust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport of dust in the disks Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport can lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen aggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr
This overturns the usual understanding that tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless collisional fragmentation is effective The frozen zone together with global dust transport might explain &#34;slow&#34; (\sim 10^6 yr) dust evolution suggested by infrared observation of T Tauri stars and by radioactive dating of chondrites
We provide evidence of consistency between the dynamical evolution of main belt asteroids and their color evolution due to space weathering The dynamical age of an asteroid&#39;s surface \citep{bib bot05a bib nes05} is the time since its last catastrophic disruption event which is a function of the object&#39;s diameter The age of an S-complex asteroid&#39;s surface may also be determined from its color using a space weathering model \citep[e
g ][]{bib wil10 bib jed04 bib wil08 bib mar06} We used a sample of 95 S-complex asteroids from SMASS and obtained their absolute magnitudes and $u g r i z$ filter magnitudes from SDSS The absolute magnitudes yield a size-derived age distribution The $u g r i z$ filter magnitudes lead to the principal component color which yields a color-derived age distribution by inverting our color-age relationship
an enhanced version of the `dual $\tau$&#39; space weathering model of \citet{bib wil10} <br>We fit the size-age distribution to the enhanced dual $\tau$ model and found characteristic weathering and gardening times of $\tau_w = 2050 \pm 80$ Myr and $\tau_g = 4400^{+700}_{-500}$ Myr respectively The fit also suggests an initial principal component color of $-0
Since the discovery of the first extra-solar planets we are confronted with the puzzling diversity of planetary systems Processes like planet radial migration in gas-disks and planetary orbital instabilities often invoked to explain the exotic orbits of the extra-solar planets at first sight do not seem to have played a role in our system
In reality though there are several aspects in the structure of our Solar System that cannot be explained in the classic scenario of in-situ formation and smooth evolution of the giant planets This paper describes a new view of the evolution of the outer Solar System that emerges from the so-called &#39;Nice model&#39; and its recent extensions
The story provided by this model describes a very &#34;dynamical&#34; Solar System with giant planets affected by both radial migrations and a temporary orbital instability Thus the diversity between our system and those found so far around other stars does not seem to be due to different processes that operated here and elsewhere
In view of the assumption that any planetary system is likely to be composed of more than one planet and the multiple planet system with a large mass planet has more chance of detailed follow-up observations the multiple planet system may be an efficient way to search for sub-Jovian planets
We compare the magnification pattern of the triple lens system with that of a best-fitted binary system composed of a star and a Jovian mass planet and check the probability in detecting the low-mass secondary planet whose signature will be superposed on that of the primary Jovian mass planet Detection probabilities of the low-mass planet in the triple lens system are quite similar to the probability in detecting such a low-mass planet in a binary system with a star and only a low-mass planet
which shows that the signature of a low-mass planet can be effectively detected even when it is concurrent with the signature of the more massive planet implying that the binary superposition approximation works over a relatively broad range of planet mass ratio and separations and the inaccuracies thereof do not significantly affect the detection probability of the lower mass secondary planet
Since the signature of the Jovian mass planet will be larger and lasts longer thereby warranting more intensive follow-up observations the actual detection rate of the low-mass planet in a triple system with a Jovian mass can be significantly higher than that in a binary system with a low-mass planet only
A possible transit of HAT-P-13c has been predicted to occur on 2010 April 28 Here we report on the results of a multi-site campaign that has been organised to detect the event CCD photometric observations have been carried out at five observatories in five countries We reached 30% time coverage in a 5 days interval centered on the suspected transit of HAT-P-13c
Two transits of HAT-P-13b were also observed No transit of HAT-P-13c has been detected while the campaign was on By a numerical experiment with 10^5 model systems we conclude that HAT-P-13c is not a transiting exoplanet with a significance level from 65% to 72% depending on the planet parameters and the prior assumptions
Hot Jupiter atmospheres exhibit fast weakly-ionized winds The interaction of these winds with the planetary magnetic field generates drag on the winds and leads to ohmic dissipation of the induced electric currents We study the magnitude of ohmic dissipation in representative three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b
We find that ohmic dissipation can reach or exceed 1% of the stellar insolation power in the deepest atmospheric layers in models with and without dragged winds Such power dissipated in the deep atmosphere appears sufficient to slow down planetary contraction and explain the typically inflated radii of hot Jupiters
This atmospheric scenario does not require a top insulating layer or radial currents that penetrate deep in the planetary interior Circulation in the deepest atmospheric layers may actually be driven by spatially non-uniform ohmic dissipation A consistent treatment of magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation is required to further elucidate the consequences of magnetic effects for the atmospheres and the contracting interiors of hot Jupiters
Asteroid pairs sharing similar heliocentric orbits were found recently Backward integrations of their orbits indicated that they separated gently with low relative velocities but did not provide additional insight into their formation mechanism A previously hypothesized rotational fission process4 may explain their formation - critical predictions are that the mass ratios are less than about 0
as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit the spin period of the larger body becomes long Here we report photometric observations of a sample of asteroid pairs revealing that primaries of pairs with mass ratios much less than 0 2 rotate rapidly near their critical fission frequency As the mass ratio approaches 0
the primary period grows long This occurs as the total energy of the system approaches zero requiring the asteroid pair to extract an increasing fraction of energy from the primary&#39;s spin in order to escape We do not find asteroid pairs with mass ratios larger than 0 2 Rotationally fissioned systems beyond this limit have insufficient energy to disrupt
First generation optical coronagraphic telescopes will obtain images of cool gas and ice giant exoplanets around nearby stars The albedo spectra of exoplanets at planet-star separations larger than about 1 AU are dominated by reflected light to beyond 1 {\mu}m and are punctuated by molecular absorption features We consider how exoplanet albedo spectra and colors vary as a function of planet-star separation
metallicity mass and observed phase for Jupiter and Neptune analogs from 0 35 to 1 {\mu}m We model Jupiter analogs with 1x and 3x the solar abundance of heavy elements and Neptune analogs with 10x and 30x Our model planets orbit a solar analog parent star at separations of 0
and 10 AU We use a radiative-convective model to compute temperature-pressure profiles The giant exoplanets are cloud-free at 0 8 AU have H2O clouds at 2 AU and have both NH3 and H2O clouds at 5 AU and 10 AU For each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as a function of phase
The presence and structure of clouds strongly influence the spectra Since the planet images will be unresolved their phase may not be obvious and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between the effects of planet-star separation metallicity and phase We consider the range of these combined effects on spectra and colors
For example we find that the spectral influence of clouds depends more on planet-star separation and hence temperature than metallicity and it is easier to discriminate between cloudy 1x and 3x Jupiters than between 10x and 30x Neptunes In addition to alkalis and methane our Jupiter models show H2O absorption features near 0
The theory of diffusion in many-dimensional Hamiltonian system is applied to asteroidal dynamics The general formulations developed by Chirikov is applied to the Nesvorný-Morbidelli analytic model of three-body (three-orbit) mean-motion resonances (Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid system) In particular we investigate the diffusion \emph{along} and \emph{across} the separatrices of the (5 -2 -2) resonance of the (490) Veritas asteroidal family and their relationship to diffusion in semi-major axis and eccentricity
We report the discovery of planets orbiting two bright nearby early K dwarf stars HD 97658 and Gl 785 These planets were detected by Keplerian modelling of radial velocities measured with Keck-HIRES for the NASA-UC Eta-Earth Survey HD 97658 b is a close-in super-Earth with minimum mass Msini = 8
orbital period P = 9 494 +/- 0 005 d and an orbit that is consistent with circular Gl 785 b is a Neptune-mass planet with Msini = 21 6 +/- 2 0 M_Earth P = 74 39 +/- 0 12 d and orbital eccentricity 0 30 +/- 0 09
In the last years experiments have shown that collisions above the fragmentation threshold velocity are a potentially important growth process for protoplanatary dust aggregates To obtain deeper understanding of this process we performed laboratory and drop-tower experiments to study multiple impacts of small porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets
Projectile and target consisted of 1 5 micron monodisperse spherical SiO2 monomers with volume filling factors of 0 15 (projectiles) and 0 45 (targets) The projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in vacuum
We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor for different impact velocities between 1 5 and 6 0 m/s The experiments at the lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity conditions Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the accretion efficiency with increasing velocity
In the laboratory experiments the accretion efficiency increases from 0 12 to 0 21 in units of the projectile mass The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the target From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the grown structures
We present a semi-analytic model atmosphere for close-in exoplanets that captures the essential physics of phase curves orbital and viewing geometry advection and re-radiation We calibrate the model with the well-characterized transiting planet HD 189733b then compute light curves for seven of the most eccentric transiting planets We present phase variations for a variety of different radiative times and wind speeds
In the limit of instant re-radiation the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet&#39;s eccentricity and argument of pericenter the light curve maximum leads or trails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or approaching the star at superior conjunction respectively For a planet with non-zero radiative timescales
the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating winds and late for sub-rotating winds We find that for a circular orbit the timing of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction indicates the direction of the dominant winds but cannot break the degeneracy between wind speed and radiative time
For circular planets the phase minimum occurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that the coolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does not convey any additional information In general increasing the advective frequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough amplitude of phase variations
but there are interesting exceptions to these trends Lastly eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer than their radiative time exhibit &#34;ringing&#34; whereby the hot spot generated at periastron rotates in and out of view The existence of ringing makes it possible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and the radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing)
Transiting planet discoveries have largely been restricted to the short-period or low-periastron distance regimes due to the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability Through the refinement of planetary orbital parameters and hence reducing the size of transit windows long-period planets become feasible targets for photometric follow-up Here we describe the TERMS project that is monitoring these host stars at predicted transit times
It has been widely thought that measuring the misalignment angle between the orbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was a good discriminator between different migration processes for hot-Jupiters Specifically well-aligned hot-Jupiter systems (as measured by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration through interaction with a viscous disk
while misaligned systems were thought to have undergone a more violent dynamical history These conclusions were based on the assumption that the planet-forming disk was well-aligned with the host star Recent work by a number of authors has challenged this assumption by proposing mechanisms that act to drive the star-disk interaction out of alignment during the pre-main sequence phase
The destruction of planets by migration into the star will release significant amounts of energy and material which will present opportunities to observational study planets in new ways To observe planet destruction it is important to understand the processes of how this energy and material is released as planets are destroyed
It is not known how fast the large amounts of energy and material are released making it difficult to predict how observable planet destruction will be There is a huge amount of energy made available by falling deep into the star&#39;s potential well Simple calculations show that many of the currently known &#34;hot Jupiters&#34; can potentially produce events as luminous as a small nova if the energy is released fast enough
To observe these events the important questions are how will this energy be released and whether the energy will be released rapidly enough to create an event luminous enough to be found by transient surveys <br>Alternatively if planet destruction is slowed by the inward migration alternating with periods of outward migration caused by Roche lobe overflow (RLOF)
then the primary signature may be the effects of the release of large amounts of gas The infall of this gas also may significantly contribute to the system&#39;s luminosity The release of planetary gas may be a searchable signature of planet destruction Signs of runaway RLOF and outward or alternating RLOF should be searched for
We present SuperWASP observations of HAT-P-14b a hot Jupiter discovered by Torres et al The planet was found independently by the SuperWASP team and named WASP-27b after follow-up observations had secured the discovery but prior to the publication by Torres et al Our analysis of HAT-P-14/WASP-27 is in good agreement with the values found by Torres et al
and we refine the parameters by combining our datasets We also provide additional evidence against astronomical false positives Due to the brightness of the host star V = 10 HAT-P-14 is an attractive candidate for further characterisation observations The planet has a high impact parameter b = 0 907 +/- 0
and the primary transit is close to grazing This could readily reveal small deviations in the orbital parameters indicating the presence of a third body in the system which may be causing the small but significant orbital eccentricity e = 0 095 +/- 0 011 The system geometry suggests that the planet narrowly fails to undergo a secondary eclipse
The long-term dynamics of Oort cloud comets are studied under the influence of both the radial and the vertical components of the Galactic tidal field Sporadic dynamical perturbation processes are ignored such as passing stars since we aim to study the influence of just the axisymmetric Galactic tidal field on the cometary motion and how it changes in time
We use a model of the Galaxy with a disc bulge and dark halo and a local disc density and disc scale length constrained to fit the best available observational constraints By integrating a few million of cometary orbits over 1 Gyr we calculate the time variable flux of Oort cloud comets that enter the inner Solar System
for the cases of a constant Galactic tidal field and a realistically varying tidal field which is a function of the Sun&#39;s orbit The applied method calculates the evolution of the comets by using first-order averaged mean elements We find that the periodicity in the cometary flux is complicated and quasi-periodic
Runway growth is an important stage in planet formation during which large protoplanets form while most of the initial mass remains in small planetesimals The amount of mass converted into large protoplanets and their resulting size distribution are not well understood Here we use analytic work that we confirm by coagulation simulations
to describe runaway growth and the corresponding evolution of the velocity dispersion We find that runaway growth proceeds as follows Initially all the mass resides in small planetesimals with mass surface density \sigma and large protoplanets start to form by accreting small planetesimals This growth continues until growth by merging large protoplanets becomes comparable to growth by planetesimal accretion
This condition sets in when \Sigma/\sigma ~\alpha^{3/4} ~ 10^{-3} where \Sigma is the mass surface density in protoplanets in a given logarithmic mass interval and \alpha is the ratio of the size of a body to its Hill radius From then on protoplanetary growth and the evolution of the velocity dispersion become self-similar and \Sigma remains roughly constant
since an increase in \Sigma by accretion of small planetesimals is balanced by a decrease due to merging with large protoplanets We show that this growth leads to a protoplanet size distribution given by N(&gt;R) \propto R^{-3} where N(&gt;R) is the number of objects with radii greater than R (i
e a differential power-law index of 4) We apply our results to the Kuiper Belt which is a relic of runaway growth Our results successfully match the observed Kuiper belt size distribution they illuminate the physical processes that shaped it and explain the total mass that is present in large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) today
We present observations of three distinct transits of HD 17156b obtained with the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) We analyzed both the transit photometry and previously published radial velocities to find the planet-star radius ratio R_p/R_s = 0 07454 +/- 0 00035 inclination i=86
and scaled semi-major axis a/R = 23 19 +0 32/-0 27 This last value translates directly to a mean stellar density determination of 0 522 +0 021/-0 018 g cm^-3 Analysis of asteroseismology observations by the companion paper of Gilliland et al (2009) provides a consistent but significantly refined measurement of the stellar mean density
We compare stellar isochrones to this density estimate and find M_s = 1 275 +/- 0 018 M_sun and a stellar age of $3 37 +0 20/-0 47 Gyr Using this estimate of M_s and incorporating the density constraint from asteroseismology we model both the photometry and published radial velocities to estimate the planet radius R_p= 1
The planet radius is larger than that found in previous studies and consistent with theoretical models of a solar-composition gas giant of the same mass and equilibrium temperature For the three transits we determine the times of mid-transit to a precision of 6 2 s 7 6 s and 6
Turbulence and angular momentum transport in accretion disks remains a topic of debate With the realization that dead zones are robust features of protoplanetary disks the search for hydrodynamical sources of turbulence continues A possible source is the baroclinic instability (BI) which has been shown to exist in unmagnetized non-barotropic disks
We present shearing box simulations of baroclinicly unstable magnetized 3D disks in order to assess the interplay between the BI and other instabilities namely the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and the magneto-elliptical instability We find that the vortices generated and sustained by the baroclinic instability in the purely hydrodynamical regime do not survive when magnetic fields are included
The MRI by far supersedes the BI in growth rate and strength at saturation The resulting turbulence is virtually identical to an MRI-only scenario We measured the intrinsic vorticity profile of the vortex finding little radial variation in the vortex core Nevertheless the core is disrupted by an MHD instability
which we identify with the magneto-elliptic instability This instability has nearly the same range of unstable wavelengths as the MRI but has higher growth rates In fact we identify the MRI as a limiting case of the magneto-elliptic instability when the vortex aspect ratio tends to infinity (pure shear flow)
We conclude that vortex excitation and self-sustenance by the baroclinic instability in protoplanetary disks is viable only in low ionization i e the dead zone Our results are thus in accordance with the layered accretion paradigm A baroclinicly unstable dead zone should be characterized by the presence of large-scale vortices whose cores are elliptically unstable
We carry out a resolution study on the fragmentation boundary of self-gravitating discs We perform three-dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs to determine whether the critical value of the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale beta_{crit} converges with increasing resolution Using particle numbers ranging from 31 250 to 16 million (the highest resolution simulations to date) we do not find convergence
Instead fragmentation occurs for longer cooling timescales as the resolution is increased These results suggest that at the very least the critical value of the cooling timescale is longer than previously thought However the absence of convergence also raises the question of whether or not a critical value exists In light of these results
We present results examining the fate of the Trojan clouds produced in our previous work We find that the stability of Neptunian Trojans seems to be strongly correlated to their initial post-migration orbital elements with those objects that survive as Trojans for billions of years displaying negligible orbital evolution The great majority of these survivors began the integrations with small eccentricities (e &lt; 0
The survival rate of &#34;pre-formed&#34; Neptunian Trojans (which in general survived on dynamically cold orbits (e &lt; 0 1 i &lt; 5 - 10°)) varied between ~5 and 70% By contrast the survival rate of &#34;captured&#34; Trojans (on final orbits spread across a larger region of e-i element space) were markedly lower
ranging between 1 and 10% after 4 Gyr Taken in concert with our earlier work we note that planetary formation scenarios which involve the slow migration (a few tens of millions of years) of Neptune from an initial planetary architecture that is both resonant and compact (aN &lt; 18 AU) provide the most promising fit of those we considered to the observed Trojan population
In such scenarios we find that the current day Trojan population would number ~1% of that which was present at the end of the planet&#39;s migration with the bulk being sourced from captured rather than pre-formed objects We note however that even those scenarios still fail to reproduce the currently observed portion of the Neptune Trojan population moving on orbits with e &lt; 0
Dynamical integrations of the currently observed Trojans show that five out of the seven are dynamically stable on 4 Gyr timescales while 2001 QR322 exhibits significant dynamical instability The seventh Trojan object 2008 LC18 has such large orbital uncertainties that only future studies will be able to determine its stability
The questions of how planets form and how common Earth-like planets are can be addressed by measuring the distribution of exoplanet masses and orbital periods We report the occurrence rate of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than 50 days) based on precise Doppler measurements of 166 Sun-like stars We measured increasing planet occurrence with decreasing planet mass (M)
Extrapolation of a power law mass distribution fitted to our measurements df/dlogM = 0 39M^-0 48 predicts that 23% of stars harbor a close-in Earth-mass planet (ranging from 0 5 to 2 0 Earth masses) Theoretical models of planet formation predict a deficit of planets in the domain from 5 to 30 Earth masses and with orbital periods less than 50 days
The recent detection of the transit of very massive substellar companions (CoRoT-3b Deleuil et al 2008; CoRoT-15b Bouchy et al 2010; WASP-30b Anderson et al 2010; Hat-P-20b Bakos et al 2010) provides a strong constraint to planet and brown dwarf formation and migration mechanisms Whether these objects are brown dwarfs originating from the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular cloud that
at the same time gave birth to the more massive stellar companion or whether they are planets that formed through core accretion of solids in the protoplanetary disk can not always been determined unambiguously and the mechanisms responsible for their short orbital distances are not yet fully understood <br>In this contribution
we examine the possibility to constrain the nature of a massive substellar object from the various observables provided by the combination of Radial Velocity and Photometry measurements (e g M_p R_p M_s Age a e ) <br>In a second part developments in the modeling of tidal evolution at high eccentricity and inclination - as measured for HD 80 606 with e=0
A high level of diversity has already been observed among the planets of our own Solar System As such one expects extrasolar planets to present a wide range of distinctive features therefore the characterisation of Earth- and super Earth-like planets is becoming of key importance in scientific research The SEARCH (Spectropolarimetric Exoplanet AtmospheRe CHaracerisation) mission proposal of this paper represents one possible approach to realising these objectives
The mission goals of SEARCH include the detailed characterisation of a wide variety of exoplanets ranging from terrestrial planets to gas giants More specifically SEARCH will determine atmospheric properties such as cloud coverage surface pressure and atmospheric composition and may also be capable of identifying basic surface features To resolve a planet with a semi major axis of down to 1
with elliptical rim cut out of a parabolic mirror This will yield an effective diameter of 9 meters along one axis A phase mask coronagraph along with an integral spectrograph will be used to overcome the contrast ratio of star to planet light Such a mission would provide invaluable data on the diversity present in extrasolar planetary systems and much more could be learned from the similarities and differences compared to our own Solar System
The thesis deals with the first stage of planet formation namely dust coagulation from micron to millimeter sizes in circumstellar disks For the first time we collect and compile the recent laboratory experiments on dust aggregates into a collision model that can be implemented into dust coagulation models We put this model into a Monte Carlo code that uses representative particles to simulate dust evolution
Simulations are performed using three different disk models in a local box (0D) located at 1 AU distance from the central star We find that the dust evolution does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycle but growth is halted by bouncing before the fragmentation regime is reached We call this the bouncing barrier which is an additional obstacle during the already complex formation process of planetesimals
The absence of the growth-fragmentation cycle and the halted growth has two important consequences for planet formation 1) It is observed that disk atmospheres are dusty throughout their lifetime Previous models concluded that the small continuously produced fragments can keep the disk atmospheres dusty We however show that small fragments are not produced because bouncing prevents fragmentation
their sizes are smaller compared to the sizes reached in previous dust models We decided to investigate point 1) in more detail A vertical column of a disk (1D) is modeled including the sedimentation of the particles We find that already intermediate levels of turbulence can prevent particles settling to the midplane
Most of the observed extrasolar planets are found on tight and often eccentric orbits The high eccentricities are not easily explained by planet-formation models which predict that planets should be on rather circular orbits Here we explore whether fly-bys involving planetary systems with properties similar to those of the gas giants in the solar system
can produce planets with properties similar to the observed planets Using numerical simulations we show that fly-bys can cause the immediate ejection of planets and sometimes also lead to the capture of one or more planets by the intruder More common however is that fly-bys only perturb the orbits of planets
sometimes leaving the system in an unstable state Over time-scales of a few million to several hundred million years after the fly-by this perturbation can trigger planet-planet scatterings leading to the ejection of one or more planets For example in the case of the four gas giants of the solar system
the fraction of systems from which at least one planet is ejected more than doubles in 10^8 years after the fly-by The remaining planets are often left on more eccentric orbits similar to the eccentricities of the observed extrasolar planets We combine our results of how fly-bys effect solar-system-like planetary systems
with the rate at which encounters in young stellar clusters occur For example we measure the effects of fly-bys on the four gas giants in the solar system We find that for such systems between 5 and 15 per cent suffer ejections of planets in 10^8 years after fly-bys in typical open clusters
The radial velocity (RV) method for detecting extrasolar planets has been the most successful to date The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet around a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement uncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs This requires relying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise
Artifacts introduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine planets that should be easily detected otherwise Here we discuss a particularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly aliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet This problem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection of a 3
The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g) corresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously reported planet GJ 581d Although the star is stable the combination of the observing cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period misinterpretations In this work
we determine whether the detection of GJ 581g is justified given this degeneracy We also discuss the implications of our analysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set which failed to confirm the existence of the new planet Performing a number of statistical tests we show that
Both ground and space-based transit observatories are poised to significantly increase the number of known transiting planets and the number of precisely measured transit times The variation in a planet&#39;s transit times may be used to infer the presence of additional planets Deducing the masses and orbital parameters of such planets from transit time variations (TTVs) alone is a rich and increasingly relevant dynamical problem
In this work we evaluate the extent of the degeneracies in this process systematically explore the dependence of TTV signals on several parameters and provide phase space plots that could aid observers in planning future observations Our explorations are focused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation a known transiting short-period Neptune or Jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber on a nearly-coplanar orbit
Through approximately 10^7 N-body simulations we demonstrate how TTV signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due to slight variations in any one orbital parameter (0 001 AU in semimajor axis 0 005 in eccentricity or a few degrees in orbital angles) and quantify the number of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain a reasonable opportunity to characterize the unseen planet (approximately greater or equal to 50 observations)
Planets in or near period commensurabilities of the form p q where p &lt; 21 and q &lt; 4 produce distinct TTV signatures regardless of whether the planets are actually locked in a mean motion resonance We distinguish these systems from the secular systems in our explorations Additionally we find that computing the autocorrelation function of a TTV signal can provide a useful diagnostic for identifying possible orbits for additional planets and suggest that this method could aid integration of TTV signals in future studies of particular exosystems
We report the results of dynamical simulations covering Gyr timescales of fictitious Scattered Disk Objects as a follow-up to an earlier study by Fernández et al (2004 {\it Icarus} {\bf 172} 372) Our dynamical model is similar in that it does not include external agents like passing stars or the Galactic tide
Only the four giant planets are explicitly treated as perturbers We analyze the random-walk behaviour of the inverse semi-major axis by means of a simplified circular restricted 3-body problem as an approximate analogue Our results concerning the role of resonant effects and the transfer efficiency into the orbital energy domain of the inner Oort Cloud are in broad agreement with the earlier papers
We have designed an inquiry-based laboratory activity on transiting extrasolar planets for an introductory college-level astronomy class The activity was designed with the intent of simultaneously teaching science process skills and factual content about transits and light curves In the activity groups of two to four students each formulate a specific science question and design and carry out an investigation using a table-top model of a star and orbiting planet
Each group then presents their findings to other students in their class In a final presentation the instructors integrate students&#39; findings with a summary of how measured light curves indicate properties of planetary systems The activity debuted at Hartnell College in November 2009 and has also been adapted for a lecture-based astronomy course at U
We measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets CoRoT-1 at 3 6 and 4 5 microns and CoRoT-2 at 3 6 microns both using Warm Spitzer We find that the Warm Spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science For consistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic Spitzer data for secondary eclipses of CoRoT-2 at 4
We compare the total data for both planets including optical eclipse measurements by the CoRoT mission and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns to existing models Both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4 5 than at 3 6 microns which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion The spectrum of CoRoT-1 is best reproduced by a 2460K blackbody
due either to a high altitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance or an isothermal region in the planetary atmosphere The spectrum of CoRoT-2 is unusual because the 8 micron contrast is anomalously low Non-inverted atmospheres could potentially produce the CoRoT-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emission from CO at 4
caused by tidal-induced mass loss However the viability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannot be more than about 30-percent larger than the planet&#39;s transit radius based on the ingress and egress times at eclipse An alternative possibility to account for the spectrum of CoRoT-2 is an additional opacity source that acts strongly at wavelengths less than 5 microns
The origin of the irregular satellites of the giant planets has been long debated since their discovery Their dynamical features argue against an in-situ formation suggesting they are captured bodies yet there is no global consensus on the physical process at the basis of their capture In this paper we explore the collisional capture scenario
where the actual satellites originated from impacts occurred within Saturn&#39;s influence sphere By modeling the inverse capture problem we estimated the families of orbits of the possible parent bodies and the specific impulse needed for their capture The orbits of these putative parent bodies are compared to those of the minor bodies of the outer Solar System to outline their possible region of formation
Three-dimensional studies of convection in deep spherical shells have been used to test the hypothesis that the strong jet streams on Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune result from convection throughout the molecular envelopes Due to computational limitations these simulations must adopt viscosities and heat fluxes many orders of magnitude larger than the planetary values
Several numerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed varies with heat flux and viscosity but no previous theories have been advanced to explain these trends Here we show using simple arguments that if convective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them the mean jet speeds split into two regimes
When the convection is weakly nonlinear the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu where F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity When the convection is strongly nonlinear the jet speeds are faster and should scale approximately as (F/nu)^{1/2} We demonstrate how this regime shift can naturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency with heat flux and viscosity
Moreover the simulations hint at a third regime where at sufficiently small viscosities the jet speed becomes independent of the viscosity We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime exists mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power Our scalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous Boussinesq and anelastic
three-dimensional simulations of convection within giant planets over a broad range of parameters When extrapolated to the real heat fluxes these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the molecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order of magnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level
Pairs of migrating extrasolar planets often lock into mean motion resonance as they drift inward This paper studies the convergent migration of giant planets (driven by a circumstellar disk) and determines the probability that they are captured into mean motion resonance The probability that such planets enter resonance depends on the type of resonance
the migration rate the eccentricity damping rate and the amplitude of the turbulent fluctuations This problem is studied both through direct integrations of the full 3-body problem and via semi-analytic model equations In general the probability of resonance decreases with increasing migration rate and with increasing levels of turbulence but increases with eccentricity damping
Previous work has shown that the distributions of orbital elements (eccentricity and semimajor axis) for observed extrasolar planets can be reproduced by migration models with multiple planets However these results depend on resonance locking and this study shows that entry into -- and maintenance of -- mean motion resonance depends sensitively on migration rate
Thermally-driven atmospheric escape evolves from an organized outflow (hydrodynamic escape) to escape on a molecule by molecules basis (Jeans escape) with increasing Jeans parameter the ratio of the gravitational to thermal energy of molecules in a planet&#39;s atmosphere This transition is described here using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method for a single component spherically symmetric atmosphere
When the heating is predominantly below the lower boundary of the simulation region R0 and well below the exobase this transition is shown to occur over a surprisingly narrow range of Jeans parameters evaluated at R0 {\lambda}0 ~ 2-3 The Jeans parameter {\lambda}0 ~ 2 1 roughly corresponds to the upper limit for isentropic
supersonic outflow and for {\lambda}0 &gt;3 escape occurs on a molecule by molecule basis For {\lambda}0 &gt; ~6 it is shown that the escape rate does not deviate significantly from the familiar Jeans rate evaluated at the nominal exobase contrary to what has been suggested Scaling by the Jeans parameter and the Knudsen number
We report the discovery of a Saturn-sized planet transiting a V = 11 3 K4 dwarf star every 3 9 d WASP-29b has a mass of 0 24+/-0 02 M_Jup and a radius of 0 79+/-0 05 R_Jup making it the smallest planet so far discovered by the WASP survey
We present &#39;BYTe&#39; a comprehensive &#39;hot&#39; line list for the ro-vibrational transitions of ammonia 14NH3 in its ground electronic state This line list has been computed variationally using the program suite TROVE a new spectroscopically-determined potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole moment surface BYTe is designed to be used at all temperatures up to 1500K
It comprises 1137650964 transitions in the frequency range from 0 to 12000 cm-1 constructed from 1366519 energy levels below 18000 cm-1 having J values below 36 Comparisons with laboratory data confirm the accuracy of the line list which is suitable for modelling a variety of astrophysical problems including the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs
Transiting exoplanets provide access to data to study the mass-radius relation and internal structure of extrasolar planets Long-period transiting planets allow insight into planetary environments similar to the Solar System where in contrast to hot Jupiters planets are not constantly exposed to the intense radiation of their parent stars Observations of secondary eclipses additionally permit studies of exoplanet temperatures and large-scale exo-atmospheric properties
This investigation uses the excellent HARPS radial velocity measurements of CoRoT-7 to re-determine the planet masses and to explore techniques able to determine mass and elements of planets discovered around active stars when the relative variation of the radial velocity due to the star activity cannot be considered as just noise and can exceed the variation due to the planets
The main technique used here is a self-consistent version of the high-pass filter used by Queloz et al (2009) in the first mass determination of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c The results are compared to those given by two alternative techniques (1) The approach proposed by Hatzes et al (2010) using only those nights in which 2 or 3 observations were done; (2) A pure Fourier analysis
In all cases the eccentricities are taken equal to zero as indicated by the study of the tidal evolution of the system; the periods are also kept fixed at the values given by Queloz et al Only the observations done in the time interval BJD 2 454 847 - 873 are used because they include many nights with multiple observations; otherwise it is not possible to separate the effects of the rotation fourth harmonic (5
The results of the various approaches are combined to give for the planet masses the values 8 0 \pm 1 2 MEarth for CoRoT-7b and 13 6 \pm 1 4 MEarth for CoRoT 7c An estimation of the variation of the radial velocity of the star due to its activity is also <a href="http

The pair-correlations between the positions of the six known planets in the exoplanetary system HD 10180 are studied There are six non-trivial and almost equally spaced peaks This demonstrates longer-ranged positional order between the orbits and suggests a seventh orbit at 0 92 AU that is consistent with these correlations
We analyze the physical processes of gap formation in an inviscid protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet using two-dimensional local shearing-sheet model Spiral density wave launched by the planet shocks and the angular momentum carried by the wave is transferred to the background flow The exchange of the angular momentum can affect the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet to form an underdense region
or gap around the planetary orbit We first perform weakly non-linear analyses to show that the specific vorticity formed by shock dissipation of density wave can be a source of mass flux in the vicinity of the planet and that the gap can be opened even for low-mass planets unless the migration of the planet is substantial
We then perform high resolution numerical simulations to check analytic consideration By comparing the gap opening timescale and type I migration timescale we propose a criterion for the formation of underdense region around the planetary orbit that is qualitatively different from previous studies The minimum mass required for the planet to form a dip is twice as small as previous studies if we incorporate the standard values of type I migration timescale
We observed comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) twice on UT 28 January 2009 using the UV grism of the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board the Swift Gamma Ray Burst space observatory Grism spectroscopy provides spatially resolved spectroscopy over large apertures for faint objects We developed a novel methodology to analyze grism observations of comets
and applied a Haser comet model to extract production rates of OH CS NH CN C3 C2 and dust The water production rates retrieved from two visits on this date were $6 7 \pm 0 7$ and 7 9 $\pm$ 0 7 x 1E28 molecules s-1 respectively Jets were sought (but not found) in the white-light and `OH&#39; images reported here
Transit timing analysis may be an effective method of discovering additional bodies in extrasolar systems which harbour transiting exoplanets The deviations from the Keplerian motion caused by mutual gravitational interactions between planets are expected to generate transit timing variations of transiting exoplanets In 2009 we collected 9 light curves of 8 transits of the exoplanet WASP-10b
Combining these data with published ones we found that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a periodic variation Simplified three-body models which reproduce the observed variations of timing residuals were identified by numerical simulations We found that the configuration with an additional planet of mass of $\sim$0
located close to the outer 5 3 mean motion resonance is the most likely scenario If the second planet is a transiter the estimated flux drop will be $\sim$0 3 per cent and can be observable with a ground-based telescope Moreover we present evidence that the spots on the stellar surface and rotation of the star affect the radial velocity curve giving rise to spurious eccentricity of the orbit of the first planet
This paper describes design of the trajectory and analysis of the stability of collinear point $L_2$ in the Sun-Earth system The modified restricted three body problem with additional gravitational potential from the belt is used as the model for the Sun-Earth system The effect of radiation pressure of the Sun and oblate shape of the Earth are considered
Since 2004 Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (SEDs) which are the radio signatures of lightning in Saturn&#39;s atmosphere have been observed by the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS) Despite their important time coverage these observations lack the resolution and positioning given by imaging around visible wavelengths Amateur observations from Earth have been increasing in quality and coverage since a few years
Searching for extrasolar planets around stars of different metallicity may provide strong constraints to the models of planet formation and evolution In this paper we present the overall results of a HARPS (a high-precision spectrograph mostly dedicated to deriving precise radial velocities) program to search for planets orbiting a sample of 104 metal-poor stars (selected [Fe/H] below -0
Radial velocity time series of each star are presented and searched for signals using several statistical diagnostics Stars with detected signals are presented including 3 attributed to the presence of previously announced giant planets orbiting the stars HD171028 HD181720 and HD190984 Several binary stars and at least one case of a coherent signal caused by activity-related phenomena are presented
One very promising new possible giant planet orbiting the star HD107094 is discussed and the results are analyzed in light of the metallicity-giant planet correlation We conclude that the frequency of giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars may be higher than previously thought probably reflecting the higher precision of the HARPS survey
The WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project is an exoplanet transit survey that has been automatically taking wide field images since 2004 Two instruments one in La Palma and the other in South Africa continually monitor the night sky building up light curves of millions of unique objects These light curves are used to search for the characteristics of exoplanetary transits
This first public data release (DR1) of the WASP archive makes available all the light curve data and images from 2004 up to 2008 in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres A web interface (<a href="http //www wasp le ac uk/public/" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a>) to the data allows easy access over the Internet
Solar light gets scattered at cloud top level in Venus&#39; atmosphere in the visible range which corresponds to the altitude of 67 km We present Doppler velocity measurements performed with the high resolution spectrometer MTR of the Solar telescope THEMIS (Teide Observatory Canary Island) on the sodium D2 solar line (5890 Å)
The field of exoplanetary science has diversified rapidly over recent years as the field has progressed from exoplanet detection to exoplanet characterization For those planets known to transit the primary transit and secondary eclipse observations have a high yield of information regarding planetary structure and atmospheres The current restriction of these information sources to short-period planets may be abated in part through refinement of orbital parameters
This allows precision targeting of transit windows and phase variations which constrain the dynamics of the orbit and the geometric albedo of the atmosphere Here we describe the expected phase function variations at optical wavelengths for long-period planets particularly those in the high-eccentricity regime and multiple systems in resonant and non-coplanar orbits
Bernstein et al (2004) found that the population of faint (R&gt;26) trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) known at that time was dominated by &#34;Classical&#34; objects which have low inclinations (i&lt;5 degrees) and distances 40--45 AU Since those observations the number of faint TNOs whose orbits are sufficiently well known to be classified as &#34;Classical&#34; or &#34;Excited&#34; has grown from seven to 39
The present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetary system HD 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting Saturn-mass exoplanet with a 3 0236 day period It was observed by the CoRoT satellite for 34 days during the fall of 2008 We attempt to identify at optical wavelengths
the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star We then try to improve the star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and the use of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations The data analysis relies on the Fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series
We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with light reflected by the planet Its relative amplitude is Delta Fp/F* = [13 0 26 8] ppm implying an albedo A=[0 16 0 33] or a dayside visible brightness temperature Tb ~ [1880 2030] K by assuming a radius R=1
Its orbital phase differs from that of the radial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_RV However the tiny planetary signal is strongly blended by another signal which we attribute to a telluric signal with a 1 day period We show that this signal is suppressed but not eliminated when using the time series for HD 46179 from the same CoRoT run as a reference
This detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planet should be confirmable with a longer CoRoT observation of the same field In any case it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized using ultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by CoRoT and Kepler The combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the same targets (Gaulme et al
We independently develop a simulation code following the previous dynamical Monte Carlo simulation of the diffusive shock acceleration under the isotropic scattering law during the scattering process and the same results are obtained Since the same results test the validity of the dynamical Monte Carlo method for simulating a collisionless shock
we extend the simulation toward including an anisotropic scattering law for further developing this dynamical Monte Carlo simulation Under this extended anisotropic scattering law a Gaussian distribution function is used to describe the variation of scattering angles in the particle&#39;s local frame As a result we obtain a series of different shock structures and evolutions in terms of the standard deviation values of the given Gaussian scattering angular distributions
The dynamical features of the irregular satellites of the giant planets argue against an in-situ formation and are strongly suggestive of a capture origin Since the last detailed investigations of their dynamics the total number of satellites have doubled increasing from 50 to 109 and almost tripled in the case of Saturn system
We have performed a new dynamical exploration of Saturn system to test whether the larger sample of bodies could improve our understanding of which dynamical features are primordial and which are the outcome of the secular evolution of the system We have performed detailed N--Body simulations using the best orbital data available and analysed the frequencies of motion to search for resonances and other possible perturbing effects
We took advantage of the Hierarchical Jacobian Symplectic algorithm to include in the dynamical model of the system also the gravitational effects of the two outermost massive satellites Titan and Iapetus Our results suggest that Saturn&#39;s irregular satellites have been significantly altered and shaped by the gravitational perturbations of Jupiter
Titan Iapetus and the Sun and by the collisional sweeping effect of Phoebe In particular the effects on the dynamical evolution of the system of the two massive satellites appear to be non-negligible Jupiter perturbs the satellites through its direct gravitational pull and indirectly via the effects of the Great Inequality
We present high-precision radial velocity observations of WASP-17 throughout the transit of its close-in giant planet using the MIKE spectrograph on the 6 5m Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle to be lambda = 167 4 \pm 11 2 deg
This independently confirms the previous finding that WASP-17b is on a retrograde orbit suggesting it underwent migration via a mechanism other than just the gravitational interaction between the planet and the disk Interestingly our result for lambda differs by 45 \pm 13 deg from the previously announced value and we also find that the spectroscopic transit occurs 15 \pm 5 min earlier than expected
We report here on an extension of a previous study by Kirsh et al (2009) of planetesimal-driven migration using our N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al 1998) The previous work focused on the case of a single planet of mass Mem immersed in a planetesimal disk with a power-law surface density distribution and Rayleigh distributed eccentricities and inclinations
Typically 10^4-10^5 equal-mass planetesimals were used where the gravitational force (and the back-reaction) on each planetesimal by the Sun and planetwere included while planetesimal-planetesimal interactions were neglected The runs reported on here incorporate the dynamical effects of a gas disk where the Adachi et al (1976) prescription of aerodynamic gas drag is implemented for all bodies
In some cases the Papaloizou and Larwood (2000) prescription of Type-I migration for the planet are implemented as well as a mass distribution In the gas-free cases rapid planet migration was observed - at a rate independent of the planet&#39;s mass - provided the planet&#39;s mass was not large compared to the mass in planetesimals capable of entering its Hill sphere
In such cases both inward and outward migrations can be self-sustaining but there is a strong propensity for inward migration When a gas disk is present aerodynamic drag can substantially modify the dynamics of scattered planetesimals For sufficiently large or small mono-dispersed planetesimals the planet typically migrates inward However for a range of plausible planetesimal sizes (i
e 0 5-5 0 km at 5 0 AU in a minimum mass Hayashi disk) outward migration is usually triggered often accompanied by substantial planetary mass accretion The origins of this behaviour are explained in terms of a toy model The effects of including a size distribution and torques associated with Type-I migration are also discussed
This book outlines the basic physical principles and practical methods of polarimetric remote sensing of Solar System objects and summarizes numerous advanced applications of polarimetry in geophysics and planetary astrophysics In the first chapter we present a complete and rigorous theory of electromagnetic scattering by disperse media directly based on the Maxwell equations and describe advanced physically based modeling tools
This is followed in Chapter 2 by a theoretical analysis of polarimetry as a remote-sensing tool and an outline of basic principles of polarimetric measurements and their practical implementations In Chapters 3 and 4 we describe the results of extensive ground-based aircraft and spacecraft observations of numerous Solar System objects (the Earth and other planets
planetary satellites Saturn&#39;s rings asteroids trans-Neptunian objects and comets) Theoretical analyses of these data are used to retrieve optical and physical characteristics of planetary surfaces and atmospheres as well as to identify a number of new phenomena and effects This monograph is intended for science professionals educators and graduate students specializing in remote sensing
We report the discovery of photometric oscillations in the host star of the exoplanet WASP-33 b (HD 15082) The data were obtained in the R band in both transit and out-of-transit phases from the 0 3-m telescope and the Montcabrer Observatory and the 0 8-m telescope at the Montsec Astronomical Observatory
Proper fitting and subsequent removal of the transit signal reveals stellar photometric variations with a semi-amplitude of about 1 mmag The detailed analysis of the periodogram yields a structure of significant signals around a frequency of 21 cyc per day which is typical of delta Scuti-type variable stars An accurate study of the power spectrum reveals a possible commensurability with the planet orbital motion with a factor of 26
We report the detection of three new extrasolar planets orbiting the solar type stars HD 85390 HD 90156 and HD 103197 with the HARPS spectrograph mounted on the ESO 3 6-m telescope at La Silla observatory HD 85390 has a planetary companion with a projected intermediate mass (42 0 Earth masses) on a 788-day orbit (a=1
for which there is no analogue in the solar system A drift in the data indicates the presence of another companion on a long period orbit which is however not covered by our measurements HD 90156 is orbited by a warm Neptune analogue with a minimum mass of 17 98 Earth masses (1
a period of 49 8 days (a=0 25 AU) and an eccentricity of 0 31 HD 103197 has an intermediate mass planet on a circular orbit (P=47 8 d Msini=31 2 Earth masses) We discuss the formation of planets of intermediate mass (about 30-100 Earth masses) which should be rare inside a few AU according to core accretion formation models
We have analysed very high-quality HARPS and UVES spectra of 95 solar analogs 24 hosting planets and 71 without detected planets to search for any possible signature of terrestial planets in the chemical abundances of volatile and refractory elements with respect to the solar abundances We demonstrate that stars with and without planets in this sample show similar mean abundance ratios
in particular a sub-sample of 14 planet-host and 14 &#34;single&#34; solar analogs in the metallicity range 0 14&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;0 36 In addition two of the planetary systems in this sub-sample containing each of them a super-Earth-like planet with masses in the range ~ 7-11 Earth masses have different volatile-to-refratory abundance ratios to what would be expected from the presence of a terrestial planets
The mean angular momentum associated with the collision of two celestial objects moving in almost circular heliocentric orbits was studied The results of these studies were used to develop models of the formation of binaries at the stage of rarefied preplanetesimals The models can explain a greater fraction of binaries formed at greater distances from the Sun
Sometimes there could be two centers of contraction inside the rotating preplanetesimal formed as the result of a collision between two rarefied preplanetesimals Such formation of binaries could result in binaries with almost the same masses of components separated by a large distance Formation of a disk around the primary could result because the angular momentum that was obtained by a rarefied preplanetesimal formed by collision was greater than the critical angular momentum for a solid body
The complexity of atmospheric modelling and its inherent non-linearity together with the limited amount of data of exoplanets available motivate model intercomparisons and benchmark tests In the geophysical community the Held-Suarez test is a standard benchmark for comparing dynamical core simulations of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere with different solvers based on statistically-averaged flow quantities
In the present study we perform analogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral and finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests including the standard benchmark for Earth a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth a &#34;shallow&#34; hot Jupiter model and a &#34;deep&#34; model of HD 209458b
We find qualitative and quantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth tidally-locked Earth and shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks but the agreement is less than satisfactory for the deep model of HD 209458b Further investigation reveals that closer agreement may be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal dissipation parameters in the two solvers
but it remains the case that the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation is not easily specified from first principles Irrespective of radiative transfer or chemical composition considerations our study points to limitations in our ability to accurately model hot Jupiter atmospheres with meteorological solvers at the level of ten percent for the temperature field and several tens of percent for the velocity field
We examine the effects of passing field stars on the angular momentum of a nearly radial orbit of an Oort cloud comet bound to the Sun We derive the probability density function (PDF) of the change in angular momentum from one stellar encounter assuming a uniform and isotropic field of perturbers
We show that the total angular momentum follows a Levy flight and determine its distribution function If there is an asymmetry in the directional distribution of perturber velocities the marginal probability distribution of each component of the angular momentum vector can be different The constant torque attributed to Galactic tides arises from a non-cancellation of perturbations with an impact parameter of order the semimajor axis of the comet
We report the discovery of the low-density transiting giant planet WASP-31b The planet is 0 48 Jupiter masses and 1 55 Jupiter radii It is in a 3 4-day orbit around a metal-poor late-F-type V = 11 7 dwarf star which is a member of a common proper motion pair
We report the discovery of HAT-P-26b a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the moderately bright V=11 744 K1 dwarf star GSC 0320-01027 with a period P = 4 234516 +- 0 000015 d transit epoch Tc = 2455304 65122 +- 0 00035 (BJD) and transit duration 0 1023 +- 0 0010 d
The host star has a mass of 0 82 +- 0 03 Msun radius of 0 79 + 0 10 - 0 04 Rsun effective temperature 5079 +- 88 K and metallicity [Fe/H] = -0 04 +- 0 08 The planetary companion has a mass of 0 059 +- 0
and radius of 0 565 + 0 072 - 0 032 RJ yielding a mean density of 0 40 +- 0 10 g cm-3 HAT-P-26b is the fourth Neptune-mass transiting planet discovered to date It has a mass that is comparable to those of Neptune and Uranus and slightly smaller than those of the other transiting Super-Neptunes
but a radius that is ~65% larger than those of Neptune and Uranus and also larger than those of the other transiting Super-Neptunes HAT-P-26b is consistent with theoretical models of an irradiated Neptune-mass planet with a 10 Mearth heavy element core that comprises &gt;~ 50% of its mass with the remainder contained in a significant hydrogen-helium envelope
One of the main evolutionary stages of planet formation is the dynamical evolution of planetesimal disks These disks are thought to evolve through gravitational encounters and physical collisions between single planetesimals In recent years many binary planetesimals have been observed in the Solar system indicating that the binarity of planetesimals is high
However current studies of planetesimal disks formation and evolution do not account for the role of binaries Here we point out that gravitational encounters of binary planetesimals can have an important role in the evolution of planetesimal disks Binary planetesimals catalyze close encounters between planetesimals and can strongly enhance their collision rate
The planetary system around the M star Gliese 581 contains at least three close-in potentially low-mass planets GL 581 c d and e In order to address the question of the habitability of GL 581 d we performed detailed atmospheric modeling studies for several planetary scenarios A 1D radiative-convective model was used to calculate temperature and pressure profiles of model atmospheres
assumed to be composed of molecular nitrogen water and carbon dioxide The model allows for changing surface pressures caused by evaporation/condensation of water and carbon dioxide Furthermore the treatment of the energy transport has been improved in the model to account in particular for high CO2 high-pressure Super-Earth conditions For four high-pressure scenarios of our study
the resulting surface temperatures were above 273 K indicating a potential habitability of the planet These scenarios include three CO2-dominated atmospheres (95% CO2 concentration with 5 10 and 20 bar surface pressure) and a high-pressure CO2-enriched atmosphere (5% CO2 concentration with 20 bar surface pressure) For all other considered scenarios
the calculated GL 581 d surface temperatures were below the freezing point of water suggesting that GL 581 d would not be habitable then The results for our CO2-dominated scenarios confirm very recent model results by Wordsworth et al (2010) However our model calculations imply that also atmospheres that are not CO2-dominated (i
Stars in their late stage of evolution such as Horizontal Branch stars are still largely unexplored for planets We report the detection of a planetary companion around HIP 13044 a very metal-poor star on the red Horizontal Branch based on radial velocity observations with a high-resolution spectrograph at the 2
The star&#39;s periodic radial velocity variation of P=16 2 days caused by the planet can be distinguished from the periods of the stellar activity indicators The minimum mass of the planet is 1 25 Jupiter masses and its orbital semi-major axis 0 116 AU Because HIP 13044 belongs to a group of stars that have been accreted from a disrupted satellite galaxy of the Milky Way
Observations with the adaptive optics system on the Very Large Telescope reveal that outer main belt asteroid (702) Alauda has a small satellite with primary to secondary diameter ratio of $\sim$56 The secondary revolves around the primary in 4 9143 $\pm$ 0 007 days at a distance of 1227 $\pm$ 24 km
We report the discovery of WASP-38b a long period transiting planet in an eccentric 6 871815 day orbit The transit epoch is 2455335 92050 +/- 0 00074 (HJD) and the transit duration is 4 663 hours WASP-38b&#39;s discovery was enabled due to an upgrade to the SuperWASP-North cameras We performed a spectral analysis of the host star HD 146389/BD+10 2980 that yielded Teff = 6150 +/- 80K
logg =4 3 +/- 0 1 vsini=8 6 +/- 0 4 km/s M*=1 16 +/- 0 04 Msun and R* =1 33 +/- 0 03 Rsun consistent with a dwarf of spectral type F8 Assuming a main-sequence mass-radius relation for the star we fitted simultaneously the radial velocity variations and the transit light curves to estimate the orbital and planetary parameters
The planet has a mass of 2 69 +/- 0 06 Mjup and a radius of 1 09 +/-0 03 Rjup giving a density rho_p = 2 1 +/-0 1 rho_jup The high precision of the eccentricity e=0 0314 +/- 0 0044 is due to the relative transit timing from the light curves and the RV shape
We present four new transits of the planetary system TrES-3 observed between 2009 May and 2010 June Among these the third transit by itself indicates possible evidence for brightness disturbance which might be the result of the planet blocking a cool starspot on the stellar surface A total of 109 transit times
including our measurements were used to determine the improved ephemeris with a transit epoch of 2454185 910944$\pm$0 000072 HJED and an orbital period of 1 30618700$\pm$0 00000015 d We analyzed the transit light curves using the JKTEBOP code and adopting the quadratic limb-darkening law In order to derive the physical properties of the TrES-3 system
the transit parameters are combined with the empirical relations from eclipsing binary stars and stellar evolutionary models The stellar mass and radius obtained from a calibration using $T_A$ log $\rho_{\rm A}$ and [Fe/H] are consistent with those from the isochrone analysis We found that the exoplanet TrES-3b has a mass of 1
Empirical evidence suggests a tantalising but unproven link between various indicators of solar activity and the barycentric motion of the Sun The latter is exemplified by transitions between regular and more disordered motion modulated by the motions of the giant planets and rare periods of retrograde motion with negative orbital angular momentum
An examination of the barycentric motion of exoplanet host stars and their stellar activity cycles has the potential of proving or disproving the Sun&#39;s motion as an underlying factor in the complex patterns of short- and long-term solar variability indices by establishing whether such correlations exist in other planetary systems
A variety of complex patterns of barycentric motions of exoplanet host stars is demonstrated depending on the number masses and orbits of the planets Each of the behavioural types proposed to correlate with solar activity are also evident in exoplanet host stars repetitive patterns influenced by massive multiple planets epochs of rapid change in orbital angular momentum
and intervals of negative orbital angular momentum The study provides the basis for independent investigations of the widely-studied but unproven suggestion that the Sun&#39;s motion is somehow linked to various indicators of solar activity We show that because of the nature of their barycentric motions the host stars HD168443 and HD74156 offer particularly powerful tests of this hypothesis
We carry out a resolution study on the fragmentation boundary of self-gravitating discs We perform three-dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of discs to determine whether the critical value of the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale beta_{crit} converges with increasing resolution Using particle numbers ranging from 31
Instead fragmentation occurs for longer cooling timescales as the resolution is increased These results certainly suggest that beta_{crit} is larger than previously thought However the absence of convergence also questions whether or not a critical value exists In light of these results we caution against using cooling timescale or gravitational stress arguments to deduce whether gravitational instability may or may not have been the formation mechanism for observed planetary systems
Dwarf stars are believed to have small protostar disk where planets may grow up During the planet formation stage embryos undergoing type I migration are expected to be stalled at inner edge of magnetic inactive disk ($a_{\rm crit} \sim 0 2-0 3 ~$AU) This mechanism makes the location around $a_{\rm crit}$ a sweet spot of forming planets
Especially $a_{\rm crit}$ of dwarf stars with masses $\sim 0 5 M_\odot$ is roughly inside the habitable zone of the system In this paper we study the formation of habitable planets due to this mechanism with a model system OGLE-06-109L It has a $0 51 M_\odot$ dwarf star with two giant planets in 2
We model the embryos undergoing type I migration in the gas disk with a constant disk accretion rate ($\dot M$) Giant planets in outside orbits affect the formation of habitable planets through secular perturbations at the early stage and secular resonance at the later stage We find that the existence and the masses of the habitable planets in OGLE-06-10L system depend on both $\dot M$ and the speed of type I migration
If planets formed earlier so that $\dot M$ is larger ($\sim 10^{-7} M_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$) terrestrial planet can not be survived unless the type I migration rate is an order of magnitude less If planets formed later so that $\dot M$ is smaller ($\sim 10^{-8} M_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$) single and high mass terrestrial planets with high water contents ($\sim 5% $) will be formed by inward migration of outer planet cores
For the 451 stars of the HARPS high precision program we study correlations between the radial-velocity (RV) variation and other parameters of the Cross Correlated Function (CCF) After a careful target selection we found a very good correlation between the slope of the RV-activity index (log(R&#39;HK) correlation and the Teff for dwarf stars
We attempt to confirm bright non-LTE emission from the exoplanet HD189733b at 3 25 microns as recently reported by Swain et al (2010) based on observations at low spectral resolving power (R ~ 30) Non-LTE emission lines from gas in an exoplanet atmosphere will not be significantly broadened by collisions
so the measured emission intensity per resolution element must be substantially brighter when observed at high spectral resolving power We observed the planet before during and after a secondary eclipse event at a resolving power R = 27 000 using the NIRSPEC spectrometer on the Keck II telescope Our spectra cover a spectral window near the peak found by Swain et al
and we compare emission cases that could account for the magnitude and wavelength dependence of the Swain et al result with our final spectral residuals To model the expected line emission we use a general non-equilibrium formulation to synthesize emission features from all plausible molecules that emit in this spectral region
In every case we detect no line emission to a high degree of confidence After considering possible explanations for the Swain et al results and the disparity with our own data we conclude that an astrophysical source for the putative non-LTE emission is unlikely We note that the wavelength dependence of the signal seen by Swain et al
In 1970 the Soviet Lunokhod 1 rover delivered a French-built laser reflector to the Moon Although a few range measurements were made within three months of its landing these measurements---and any that may have followed---are unpublished and unavailable The Lunokhod 1 reflector was therefore effectively lost until March of 2010 when images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) provided a positive identification of the rover and determined its coordinates with uncertainties of about 100 m
This allowed the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) to quickly acquire a laser signal The reflector appears to be in excellent condition delivering a signal roughly four times stronger than its twin reflector on the Lunokhod 2 rover The Lunokhod 1 reflector is especially valuable for science because it is closer to the Moon&#39;s limb than any of the other reflectors and
To take full advantage of the September 2008 opposition passage of the M-type asteroid (216) Kleopatra we have used near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) imaging with the W M Keck II telescope to capture unprecedented high resolution images of this unusual asteroid Our AO observations with the W M Keck II telescope
combined with Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic observations and past stellar occultations confirm the value of its IRAS radiometric radius of 67 5 km as well as its dog-bone shape suggested by earlier radar observations Our Keck AO observations revealed the presence of two small satellites in orbit about Kleopatra (see Marchis et al
Accurate measurements of the satellite orbits over a full month enabled us to determine the total mass of the system to be 4 64+/-0 02 10^18 Kg This translates into a bulk density of 3 6 +/-0 4 g/cm3 which implies a macroscopic porosity for Kleopatra of ~ 30-50% typical of a rubble-pile asteroid
We find the orbit of the Neptune-sized exoplanet HAT-P-11b to be highly inclined relative to the equatorial plane of its host star This conclusion is based on spectroscopic observations of two transits which allowed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to be detected with an amplitude of 1 5 m/s The sky-projected obliquity is 103_{-10}^{+26} degrees
This is the smallest exoplanet for which spin-orbit alignment has been measured The result favors a migration scenario involving few-body interactions followed by tidal dissipation This finding also conforms with the pattern that the systems with the weakest tidal interactions have the widest spread in obliquities We predict that the high obliquity of HAT-P-11 will be manifest in transit light curves from the Kepler spacecraft
We present optical photometry of 16 transits of the super-Earth GJ 1214b allowing us to refine the system parameters and search for additional planets via transit timing Starspot-crossing events are detected in two light curves and the star is found to be variable by a few percent Hence in our analysis
special attention is given to systematic errors that result from star spots The planet-to-star radius ratio is 0 11610+/-0 00048 subject to a possible upward bias by a few percent due to the unknown spot coverage Even assuming this bias to be negligible the mean density of planet can be either 3
depending on whether the stellar radius is estimated from evolutionary models or from an empirical mass-luminosity relation combined with the light curve parameters One possible resolution is that the orbit is eccentric (e approximately equal to 0 14) which would favor the higher density and hence a much thinner atmosphere for the planet
We combine nulling interferometry at 10 {\mu}m using the MMT and Keck Telescopes with spectroscopy imaging and photometry from 3 to 100 {\mu}m using Spitzer to study the debris disk around {\beta} Leo over a broad range of spatial scales corresponding to radii of 0 1 to ~100 AU We have also measured the close binary star o Leo with both Keck and MMT interferometers to verify our procedures with these instruments
The {\beta} Leo debris system has a complex structure 1 ) relatively little material within 1 AU; 2 ) an inner component with a color temperature of ~600 K fitted by a dusty ring from about 2 to 3 AU; and 3 ) a second component with a color temperature of ~120 K fitted by a broad dusty emission zone extending from about ~5 AU to ~55 AU
Planets can form and survive in close binaries although dynamical interactions with the secondary component can actually significantly impact the giant planet formation and evolution Rare close binaries hosting giant planets offer therefore an ideal laboratory to explore the properties and the stability of such extreme planetary systems In the course of our CFHT and VLT coronographic imaging survey dedicated to the search for faint companions of exoplanet host stars
a close (about 20 AU) secondary stellar companion to the exoplanet host HD196885 A was discovered For more than 4 years we have used the NaCo near-infrared adaptive optics instrument to monitor the astrometric position of HD196885 B relative to A The system was observed at five different epochs from August 2005 to August 2009 and accurate relative positions were determined
Our observations fully reject the stationary background hypothesis for HD196885 B The two components are found to be comoving The orbital motion of HD196885 B is well resolved and the orbital curvature is even detected From our imaging data combined with published radial velocity measurements we refine the complete orbital parameters of the stellar component
We derive for the first time its orbital inclination and its accurate mass We find also solutions for the inner giant planet HD196885 Ab compatible with previous independent radial velocity studies Finally we investigate the stability of the inner giant planet HD196885 Ab due to the binary companion proximity Our dynamical simulations show that the system is currently and surprisingly more stable in a high mutual inclination configuration that falls in the Kozai resonance regime
Recently Fossati et al observed that the UV transit of WASP-12b showed an early ingress compared to the optical transit We suggest that the resulting early ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion In this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation of such a bow shock
We consider two scenarios (1) the stellar magnetic field is strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit and (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma which escapes in a wind In both cases a shock capable of compressing plasma to the observed densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T &lt; (4 - 5) x 10^6 K
In the confined case the shock always forms directly ahead of the planet but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed and hence on the plasma temperature For higher wind temperatures the shock forms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star
We conclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is likely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a useful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp In the case of WASP-12b we derive an upper limit of about Bp=24 G
Gravitational instability (GI) of a dust-rich layer at the midplane of a gaseous circumstellar disk is one proposed mechanism to form planetesimals the building blocks of rocky planets and gas giant cores Self-gravity competes against the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) gradients in dust content drive a vertical shear which risks overturning the dusty subdisk and forestalling GI
To understand the conditions under which the disk can resist the KHI we perform 3D simulations of stratified subdisks in the limit that dust particles are small and aerodynamically well coupled to gas This limit screens out the streaming instability and isolates the KHI Each subdisk is assumed to have a vertical density profile given by a spatially constant Richardson number Ri
We vary Ri and the midplane dust-to-gas ratio mu and find that the critical Richardson number dividing KH-unstable from KH-stable flows is not unique; rather Ri_crit grows nearly linearly with mu for mu=0 3-10 Only for disks of bulk solar metallicity is Ri_crit ~ 0 2 close to the classical value
Our results suggest that a dusty sublayer can gravitationally fragment and presumably spawn planetesimals if embedded within a solar metallicity gas disk ~4x more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula; or a minimum-mass disk having ~3x solar metallicity; or some intermediate combination of these two possibilities Gravitational instability seems possible without resorting to the streaming instability or to turbulent concentration of particles
Dust at the midplane of a circumstellar disk can become gravitationally unstable and fragment into planetesimals if the local dust-to-gas density ratio mu is sufficiently high We simulate how dust settles in passive disks and ask how high mu can become We settle the dust using a 1D code and test for dynamical stability using a 3D shearing box code
This scheme allows us to explore the behavior of small particles having short but non-zero stopping times in gas 0 &lt; t_stop &lt;&lt; the orbital period The streaming instability is thereby filtered out Dust settles until shearing instabilities in the edges of the dust layer threaten to overturn the entire layer
In this state of marginal stability mu=2 9 for a disk whose bulk (height-integrated) metallicity is solar For a disk whose bulk metallicity is 4x solar mu reaches 26 4 These maximum values of mu which depend on the background radial pressure gradient are so large that gravitational instability of small particles is viable in disks whose bulk metallicities are just a few (&lt;4) times solar
Earlier studies assumed that dust settles until the Richardson number Ri is spatially constant Our simulations are free of this assumption but provide support for it within the dust layer&#39;s edges with the proviso that Ri increases with bulk metallicity in the same way that we found in Paper I
Orbital evolution of spherical interplanetary dust particles in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt zone is treated for semimajor axes 30-50 AU Besides solar gravity also solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation and fast interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles The solar electromagnetic radiation is represented by the Poynting-Robertson effect and the solar corpuscular radiation corresponds to the solar wind
Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust lifetime in the zone The average time for the particle stay in the zone is more than 30-times greater than the conventional case of constant (time independent) radial solar wind offers for the particles of tens micrometers in size This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles
$\bar{Q}&#39;_{pr} =$ 1 where $\bar{Q}&#39;_{pr}$ is the dimensionless efficiency factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure If $\bar{Q}&#39;_{pr} =$ 1/2 then the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4-times the conventional value The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect
We report the detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the eccentric super-Neptune exoplanet HAT-P-11b based on radial velocity measurements taken with HDS mounted on the Subaru 8 2m telescope and simultaneous photometry with the FTN 2 0m telescope both located in Hawai&#39;i The observed radial velocities during a planetary transit of HAT-P-11b show a persistent blue-shift
suggesting a spin-orbit misalignment in the system The best-fit value for the projected spin-orbit misalignment angle is $\lambda= 103_{-19}^{+23}$ deg Our result supports the notion that eccentric exoplanetary systems are likely to have significant spin-orbit misalignment (e g HD 80606 WASP-8 WASP-14 WASP-17 and XO-3) This fact suggests that not only hot-Jupiters but also super-Neptunes like HAT-P-11b had once experienced dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering or the Kozai migration
We present three transits of GJ 1214b observed as part of the Apache Point Observatory Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets (APOSTLE) We used APOSTLE r-band lightcurves in conjunction with previously gathered data of GJ 1214b to re-derive system parameters By using parameters such as transit duration and ingress/egress length we are able to reduce the degeneracies between parameters in the fitted transit model
which is a preferred condition for Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques typically used to quantify uncertainties in measured parameters The joint analysis of this multi-wavelength dataset confirms earlier estimates of system parameters including planetary orbital period the planet-to-star radius ratio and stellar density We fit the photometric spectralenergy distribution of GJ 1214 to derive stellar luminosity
which we then use to derive its absolute mass and radius From these derived stellar properties and previously published radial velocity data we were able to refine estimates of the absolute parameters for the planet GJ 1214b Transit times derived from our study show no evidence for strong transit timing variations
Some lightcurves we present show features that we believe are due to stellar activity During the first night we observed a rise in the out-of-eclipse flux of GJ 1214 with a characteristic fast-rise exponential decay shape commonly associated with stellar flares On the second night we observed a minor brightening during transit
Ejection of material after the Deep Impact collision with Comet Tempel 1 was studied based on analysis of the images made by the Deep Impact cameras during the first 13 minutes after impact Analysis of the images shows that there was a local maximum of the rate of ejection at time of ejection ~10 s with typical velocities ~100 m/s
At the same time a considerable excessive ejection in a few directions began the direction to the brightest pixel changed by ~50 deg and there was a local increase of brightness of the brightest pixel The ejection can be considered as a superposition of the normal ejection and the longer triggered outburst
Photospheric stellar activity might be an important source of noise and confusion in the radial-velocity measurements RV planet search surveys as well as follow-up of photometric transit surveys require a deeper understanding and characterization of the effects of stellar activities to disentangle it from planetary signals We simulate dark spots on a rotating stellar photosphere
The variations of the photometry RV and spectral line shapes are characterized and analyzed according to the stellar inclination the latitude and the number of spots The Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the RV variations induced by activity present power at the rotational period Prot of the star and its two-first harmonics Prot/2 and Prot/3
Three adjusted sinusoids fixed at Prot and its two-first harmonics allow to remove about 90% of the RV jitter amplitude We apply and validate our approach on four known active planet-host stars HD189733 GJ674 CoRoT-7 and iHor We succeed in fitting simultaneously activity and planetary signals on GJ674 and CoRoT-7
This simultaneous modeling of the activity and planetary parameters leads to slightly larger masses of CoRoT-7b and c respectively 5 7+/-2 5ME and 13 1+/-4 1ME The larger uncertainties take into account properly for the stellar active jitter We excluded short-period low-mass exoplanets around iHor For data with realistic time-sampling and white Gaussian noise
we use simulations to show that our approach is efficient to disentangle reflex-motion due to a planetary companion and stellar-activity induced-RV variations provided that 1) the planetary orbital period is not close to that of the stellar rotation or one of its two-first harmonics 2) the semi-amplitude of the planet exceeds 30% of the semi-amplitude of the active signal 3) the rotational period of the star is accurately known 4) the data cover more than one stellar rotational period
In this paper we find the internal stratification for terrestrial planets with given mass-radius pairs and use the core size and density to estimate their maximum dipolar magnetic moment We also comment on the temporal evolution although more information (e g core composition mantle rheology and history) is crucial in determining the state of the dynamo with planetary age
The super-Earth GJ1214b transits a nearby M dwarf that exhibits 1% intrinsic variability in the near-infrared Here we analyze new observations to refine the physical properties of both the star and planet We present three years of out-of-transit photometric monitoring of the stellar host GJ1214 from the MEarth Observatory and find the rotation period to be long
mostly likely an integer multiple of 53 days suggesting low levels of magnetic activity and an old age for the system We show such variability will not pose significant problems to ongoing studies of the planet&#39;s atmosphere with transmission spectroscopy We analyze 2 high-precision transit light curves from ESO&#39;s Very Large Telescope along with 7 others from the MEarth and FLWO 1
finding physical parameters for the planet that are consistent with previous work The VLT light curves show tentative evidence for spot occultations during transit Using two years of MEarth light curves we place limits on additional transiting planets around GJ1214 with periods out to the habitable zone of the system
The Trojan asteroids remain quite poorly understood yet their physical properties provide unique perspective on chemical and dynamical processes that shaped the Solar System The current study was undertaken to investigate surface compositions of these objects We present 66 new near-infrared (NIR; 0 7 to 2 5 microns) spectra of 58 Trojans
including members of both the leading and trailing swarms We also include in the analysis previously published NIR spectra of 13 Trojans (3 of which overlap with the new sample) This data set permits not only a direct search for compositional signatures but also a search for patterns that may reveal clues to the origin of the Trojans
We do not report any confirmed absorption features in the new spectra Analysis of the spectral slopes however reveals an interesting bimodality among the NIR data The two spectral groups identified appear to be equally abundant in the leading and trailing swarms The spectral groups are not a result of family membership; they occur in the background
non-family population The average albedos of the two groups are the same within uncertainties (0 051\pm0 016 and 0 055\pm0 016) No correlations between spectral slope and any other physical or orbital parameter are detected with the exception of a possible weak correlation with inclination among the less-red spectral group
Synthesizing these results with previously published properties we conclude that the two spectral groups represent objects with different intrinsic compositions We further suggest that while the less-red group originated near Jupiter or in the main asteroid belt the redder spectral group originated farther out in the Solar System If correct
The standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which planetesimals form from a dust disk followed by a phase of mutual planetesimal-planetesimal collisions leading eventually to the formation of planetary embryos However there is a potential transition phase (which we call the &#34;snowball phase&#34;) between the formation of the first planetesimals and the onset of mutual collisions amongst them
which has often been either ignored or underestimated in previous studies In this snowball phase isolated planetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion of sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk Using a simplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the dust
we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before mutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number of critical parameters including the degree of disk turbulence the planetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation For systems in which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and with relatively small birth size
we show that the snowball growth phase can be very important allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass before mutual collisions take over In such cases the snowball growth phase can be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals Moreover such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary gas disk
A noteworthy result is that (see the paper) For the specific case of close binaries such as Alpha Centauri (see the paper) From a more general perspective these preliminary results suggest that an efficient snowball growth phase provides a large amount of &#34;room at the bottom&#34; for theories of planet formation
Transitional T Tauri disks have optically thin holes with radii &gt; 10 AU yet accrete up to the median T Tauri rate Multiple planets inside the hole can torque the gas to high radial speeds over large distances reducing the local surface density while maintaining accretion Thus multi-planet systems together with reductions in disk opacity due to grain growth
can explain how holes can be simultaneously transparent and accreting There remains the problem of how outer disk gas diffuses into the hole Here it has been proposed that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) erodes disk surface layers ionized by stellar X-rays In contrast to previous work we find that the extent to which surface layers are MRI-active is limited not by ohmic dissipation but by ambipolar diffusion
the latter measured by Am the number of times a neutral hydrogen molecule collides with ions in a dynamical time Simulations by Hawley &amp; Stone showed that Am ~ 100 is necessary for ions to drive MRI turbulence in neutral gas We calculate that in X-ray-irradiated surface layers Am typically varies from ~0
depending on the abundance of charge-adsorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons whose properties we infer from Spitzer observations We conclude that ionization of H_2 by X-rays and cosmic rays can sustain at most only weak MRI turbulence in surface layers 1 to 10 g/cm^2 thick and that accretion rates in such layers are too small compared to observed accretion rates for the majority of disks
Spectra of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) measured at the Earth are the combination of several processes sources production and acceleration propagation in the interstellar medium and propagation in the heliosphere Inside the solar cavity the flux of GCRs is reduced due to the solar modulation the interaction which they have with the interplanetary medium
We realized a 2D stochastic simulation of solar modulation to reproduce CR spectra at the Earth and evaluated the importance in our results of the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) model and its agreement with data at high energy We show a good agreement between our model and the data taken by AMS-01 and BESS experiments during periods with different solar activity conditions
With planets orbiting stars a planetary mass function should not be seen as a low-mass extension of the stellar mass function but a proper formalism needs to take care of the fact that the statistical properties of planet populations are linked to the properties of their respective host stars This can be accounted for by describing planet populations by means of a differential planetary mass-radius-orbit function
which together with the fraction of stars with given properties that are orbited by planets and the stellar mass function allows to derive all statistics for any considered sample These fundamental functions provide a framework for comparing statistics that result from different observing techniques and campaigns which all have their very specific selection procedures and detection efficiencies
Moreover recent results both from gravitational microlensing campaigns and radial-velocity surveys of stars indicate that planets tend to cluster in systems rather than being the lonely child of their respective parent star While planetary multiplicity in an observed system becomes obvious with the detection of several planets its quantitative assessment however comes with the challenge to exclude the presence of further planets
Current exoplanet samples begin to give us first hints at the population statistics whereas pictures of planet parameter space in its full complexity call for samples that are 2-4 orders of magnitude larger In order to derive meaningful statistics however planet detection campaigns need to be designed in such a way that well-defined fully-deterministic target selection
The population of debris discs on the main sequence is well constrained however very little is known about debris discs around evolved stars In this work we provide a theoretical framework that considers the effects of stellar evolution on debris discs; firstly considering the evolution of an individual disc from the main sequence through to the white dwarf phase
then extending this to the known population of debris discs around main sequence A stars It is found that discs around evolved stars are harder to detect than on the main sequence In the context of our models discs should be detectable with Herschel or Alma on the giant branch
We consider the radial migration of vortices in two-dimensional isothermal gaseous disks We find that a vortex core orbiting at the local gas velocity induces velocity perturbations that propagate away from the vortex as density waves The resulting spiral wave pattern is reminiscent of an embedded planet There are two main causes for asymmetries in these wakes
geometrical effects tend to favor the outer wave while a radial vortensity gradient leads to an asymmetric vortex core which favors the wave at the side that has the lowest density In the case of asymmetric waves which we always find except for a disk of constant pressure there is a net exchange of angular momentum between the vortex and the surrounding disk
which leads to orbital migration of the vortex Numerical hydrodynamical simulations show that this migration can be very rapid on a time scale of a few thousand orbits for vortices with a size comparable to the scale height of the disk We discuss the possible effects of vortex migration on planet formation scenarios
The planet GJ 1214b is the second known super-Earth with a measured mass and radius Orbiting a quiet M-star it receives considerably less mass-loss driving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b so that the interior may be quite dissimilar in composition including the possibility of a large fraction of water
We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock core) structure where the envelope material is either H/He pure water or a mixture of H/He and H2O Within this framework we perform models of the thermal evolution and contraction of the planet We discuss possible compositions that are consistent with Mp=6
Rp=2 678 RE an age tau=3-10 Gyr and the irradiation level of the atmosphere These conditions require that if water exists in the interior it must remain in a fluid state with important consequences for magnetic field generation These conditions also require the atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar
depending on composition Our results bolster the suggestion of a metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet as we find water-world models that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock ratio of more than 6 1 We instead favor a H/He/H2O envelope with high water mass fraction (~0
similar to recent models of the deep envelope of Uranus and Neptune Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He envelope generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar water rock ratios Dry water-enriched and pure water envelope models differ to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k2 of respectively ~0
During the last few years our knowledge about the X-ray emission from bodies within the solar system has significantly improved Several new solar system objects are now known to shine in X-rays at energies below 2 keV Apart from the Sun the known X-ray emitters now include planets (Venus Earth
Mars Jupiter and Saturn) planetary satellites (Moon Io Europa and Ganymede) all active comets the Io plasma torus (IPT) the rings of Saturn the coronae (exospheres) of Earth and Mars and the heliosphere The advent of higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories has been of great benefit in advancing the field of planetary X-ray astronomy
Progress in modeling X-ray emission laboratory studies of X-ray production and theoretical calculations of cross-sections have all contributed to our understanding of processes that produce X-rays from the solar system bodies At Jupiter and Earth both auroral and non-auroral disk X-ray emissions have been observed X-rays have been detected from Saturn&#39;s disk
but no convincing evidence of an X-ray aurora has been observed The first soft (0 1- 2 keV) X-ray observation of Earth&#39;s aurora by Chandra shows that it is highly variable The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter Saturn and Earth those from the disk of Mars Venus and Moon and from the rings of Saturn
are mainly produced by scattering of solar X-rays The spectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets the heliosphere the geocorona and the Martian halo are quite similar but they appear to be quite different from those of Jovian auroral X-rays X-rays from the Galilean satellites and the IPT are mostly driven by impact of Jovian magnetospheric particles
We report the discovery by the CoRoT space mission of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a F7V star with an orbital period of 3 06 days CoRoT-15b has a radius of 1 12 +0 30 -0 15 Rjup a mass of 63 3 +- 4 1 Mjup and is thus the second transiting companion lying in the theoretical mass domain of brown dwarfs
CoRoT-15b is either very young or inflated compared to standard evolution models a situation similar to that of M-dwarfs stars orbiting close to solar-type stars Spectroscopic constraints and an analysis of the lightcurve favors a spin period between 2 9 and 3 1 days for the central star compatible with a double-synchronisation of the system
We present an ultra-deep survey for Neptune Trojans using the Subaru 8 2-m and Magellan 6 5-m telescopes The survey reached a 50% detection efficiency in the R-band at 25 7 magnitudes and covered 49 square degrees of sky This depth corresponds to Neptune Trojans that are about 16 km in radius (assuming an albedo of 0
A paucity of smaller Neptune Trojans (radii &lt; 45 km) compared to larger ones was found The brightest Neptune Trojans appear to follow a steep power-law slope (q = 5+-1) similar to the brightest objects in the other known stable reservoirs such as the Kuiper Belt Jupiter Trojans and main belt asteroids
We find a roll-over for the Neptune Trojans that occurs around a radii of r=45+-10 km (23 5+-0 3 mags) which is also very similar to the other stable reservoirs All the observed stable regions in the the solar system show evidence for Missing Intermediate Sized Planetesimals (MISPs) This indicates a primordial and not collisional origin
We report results of a theoretical investigation of polarization of the X-ray emissions induced in charge-exchange collisions of fully stripped solar wind ions C$^{6+}$ and O$^{8+}$ with the heliospheric hydrogen atoms The polarization of X-ray emissions has been computed for line-of-sight observations within the ecliptic plane as a function of solar wind ion velocities
including a range of velocities corresponding to the slow and fast solar wind and Coronal Mass Ejections To determine the variability of polarization of heliospheric X-ray emissions the polarization has been computed for solar minimum conditions with self-consistent parameters of the solar wind plasma and heliospheric gas and compared with the polarization calculated for an averaged solar activity
Three-body model fits to Arecibo and Goldstone radar data reveal the nature of two near-Earth asteroid triples Triple-asteroid system 2001 SN263 is characterized by a primary of ~10^13 kg an inner satellite ~1% as massive orbiting at ~3 primary radii in ~0 7 days and an outer satellite ~2 5% as massive orbiting at ~13 primary radii in ~6
Their orbital periods are ~1 2 and ~8 4 days Examination of resonant arguments shows that the satellites are not currently in a mean-motion resonance Precession of the apses and nodes are detected in both systems (2001 SN263 inner body d{\varpi}/dt ~1 1 deg/day 1994 CC inner body d{\varpi}/dt ~ -0
which is in agreement with analytical predictions of the secular evolution due to mutually interacting orbits and primary oblateness Nonzero mutual inclinations between the orbital planes of the satellites provide the best fits to the data in both systems (2001 SN263 ~14 degrees 1994 CC ~16 degrees) Our best-fit orbits are consistent with nearly circular motion
except for 1994 CC&#39;s outer satellite which has an eccentric orbit of e ~ 0 19 We examine several processes that can generate the observed eccentricity and inclinations including the Kozai and evection resonances past mean-motion resonance crossings and close encounters with terrestrial planets In particular we find that close planetary encounters can easily excite the eccentricities and mutual inclinations of the satellites&#39; orbits to the currently observed values
Terrestrial planets are more likely to be detected if they orbit M dwarfs due to the favorable planet/star size and mass ratios However M dwarf habitable zones are significantly closer to the star than the one around our Sun which leads to different requirements for planetary habitability and its detection
We review 1) the current limits to detection 2) the role of M dwarf spectral energy distributions on atmospheric chemistry 3) tidal effects stressing that tidal locking is not synonymous with synchronous rotation 4) the role of atmospheric mass loss and propose that some habitable worlds may be the volatile-rich
evaporated cores of giant planets and 5) the role of planetary rotation and magnetic field generation emphasizing that slow rotation does not preclude strong magnetic fields and their shielding of the surface from stellar activity Finally we present preliminary findings of the NASA Astrobiology Institute&#39;s workshop &#34;Revisiting the Habitable Zone
Although our solar system features predominantly circular orbits the exoplanets discovered so far indicate that this is the exception rather than the rule This could have crucial consequences for exoplanet climates both because eccentric terrestrial exoplanets could have extreme seasonal variation and because giant planets on eccentric orbits could excite Milankovitch-like variations of a potentially habitable terrestrial planet
Äôs eccentricity on timescales of thousands-to-millions of years A particularly interesting implication concerns the fact that the Earth is thought to have gone through at least one globally frozen &#34;snowball&#34; state in the last billion years that it presumably exited after several million years of buildup of greenhouse gases when the ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle
Water-rich extrasolar terrestrial planets with the capacity to host life might be at risk of falling into similar snowball states Here we show that if a terrestrial planet has a giant companion on a sufficiently eccentric orbit it can undergo Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity of great enough magnitude to melt out of a snowball state
The CO2 production rate has been derived in comets using the Cameron band (a3Pi - X1Sigma) emission of CO molecule assuming that photodissociative excitation of CO2 is the main production mechanism of CO in a3Pi metastable state We have devoloped a model for the production and loss of CO(a3Pi) which has been applied to comet 103P/Hartley 2
the target of EPOXI mission Our model calculations show that photoelectron impact excitation of CO and dissociative excitation of CO2 can together contribute about 60-90% to the Cameron band emission The modeled brightness of (0-0) Cameron band emission on comet Hartley 2 is consistent with Hubble Space Telescope observations for 3-5% CO2 (depending on model input solar flux) and 0
A promising method to detect earth-sized exoplanets is the timing analysis of a known transit The technique allows a search for variations in transit duration or center induced by the perturbation of a third body e g a second planet or an exomoon To this aim TASTE (The Asiago Survey for Timing transit variations of Exoplanets) project will collect high-precision
short-cadence light curves for a selected sample of transits by using imaging differential photometry at the Asiago 1 82m telescope The first light curves show that our project can already provide a competitive timing accuracy as well as a significant improvement over the orbital parameters We derived refined ephemerides for HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-14b with only one transit each
The standard picture of planet formation posits that giant gas planets are over-grown rocky planets massive enough to attract enormous gas atmospheres It has been shown recently that the opposite point of view is physically plausible the rocky terrestrial planets are former giant planet embryos dried of their gas &#34;to the bone&#34; by the influences of the parent star
The discovery of 9 new brown-dwarf candidates orbiting stars in the CORALIE and HARPS radial-velocity surveys is reported New CORALIE radial velocities yielding accurate orbits of 6 previously-known hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are presented Including targets selected from the literature 33 hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are examined Employing innovative methods
we use the new reduction of the Hipparcos data to fully characterise the astrometric orbits of 6 objects revealing M-dwarf companions with masses between 90 M_Jup and 0 52 M_Sun Additionally the masses of two companions can be restricted to the stellar domain The companion to HD 137510 is found to be a brown dwarf
At 95 % confidence the companion of HD 190228 is also a brown dwarf The remaining 23 companions persist as brown-dwarf candidates Based on the CORALIE planet-search sample we obtain an upper limit of 0 6 % for the frequency of brown-dwarf companions around Sun-like stars We find that the companion-mass distribution function is rising at the lower end of the brown-dwarf mass range
We study Type I migration of a planet in a radiatively efficient disk using global two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations The large positive corotation torque is exerted on a planet by an adiabatic disk at early times when the disk has the steep negative entropy gradient The gas on the horseshoe orbit of the planet is compressed adiabatically during the change of the orbit from the slow orbit to the fast orbit
increasing its density and exerting the positive torque on the planet The planet would migrate outward in the adiabatic disk before saturation sets in We further study the effect of energy dissipation by radiation on Type I migration of the planet The corotation torque decreases when the energy dissipates effectively because the density of the gas on the horseshoe orbit does not increase by the compression compared with the gas of the adiabatic disk
Most extrasolar planets currently known were discovered by means of an indirect method that measures the stellar wobble caused by the planet We previously studied a triple system composed of a star and a nearby binary on circular coplanar orbits We showed that although the effect of the binary on the star can be differentiated from the stellar wobble caused by a planet
because of observational limitations the two effects may often remain indistinguishable Here we develop a model that applies to eccentric and inclined orbits We show that the binary&#39;s effect is more likely to be mistaken by planet(s) in the case of coplanar motion observed equator-on Moreover when the orbits are eccentric
the magnitude of the binary&#39;s effect may be larger than in the circular case Additionally an eccentric binary can mimic two planets with orbital periods in the ratio 2/1 However when the star&#39;s orbit around the binary&#39;s center of mass has a high eccentricity and a reasonably well-constrained period it should be easier to distinguish the binary&#39;s effect from a planet
We have observed 7 new transits of the `hot Jupiter&#39; WASP-5b using a 61 cm telescope located in New Zealand in order to search for transit timing variations (TTVs) which can be induced by additional bodies existing in the system When combined with other available photometric and radial velocity (RV) data
we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the best fit \chi^2 values is 32 2 with 9 degrees of freedom which corresponds to a confidence level of 99 982 % or 3 7 \sigma This result indicates that excess variations of transit timings has been observed
due either to unknown systematic effects or possibly to real TTVs The TTV amplitude is as large as 50 s and if this is real it cannot be explained by other effects than that due to an additional body or bodies From the RV data we put an upper limit on the RV amplitude caused by the possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s^{-1}
which corresponds to its mass of 22-70 M_{Earth} over the orbital period ratio of the two planets from 0 2 to 5 0 From the TTVs data using the numerical simulations we place more stringent limits down to 2 M_{Earth} near 1 2 and 2 1 mean motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3 \sigma level
assuming that the two planets are co-planer We also put an upper limit on excess of Trojan mass as 43 M_{Earth} (3 \sigma) using both RV and photometric data We also find that if the possible secondary planet has non- or a small eccentricity its orbit would likely be near low-order MMRs
We report the detection of a 0 6 M_J extrasolar planet by WASP-South WASP-25b transiting its solar-type host star every 3 76 days A simultaneous analysis of the WASP FTS and Euler photometry and CORALIE spectroscopy yields a planet of R_p = 1 22 R_J and M_p = 0 58 M_J around a slightly metal-poor solar-type host star
[Fe/H] = -0 05 \pm 0 10 of R_{\ast} = 0 92 R_{\odot} and M_{\ast} = 1 00 M_{\odot} WASP-25b is found to have a density of \rho_p = 0 32 \rho_J a low value for a sub-Jupiter mass planet We investigate the relationship of planetary radius to planetary equilibrium temperature and host star metallicity for transiting exoplanets with a similar mass to WASP-25b
We study the long-term time-scale (i e period comaprable to the orbital period of the outer perturber object) transit timing variations in transiting exoplanetary systems which contain a further more distant (a_2&gt;&gt;a_1) either planetary or stellar companion <br>We give an analytical form of the O-C diagram (which describes such TTV-s) in trigonometric series
valid for arbitrary mutual inclinations up to the sixth order in the inner eccentricity We show that the dependence of the O-C on the orbital and physical parameters can be separated into three parts Two of these are independent of the real physical parameters (i e masses separations periods) of a concrete system
and depend only on dimensionless orbital elements and so can be analyzed in general We analyze these dimensionless amplitudes for different arbitrary initial parameters as well as for two particular systems CoRoT-9b and HD 80606b We find in general that while the shape of the O-C strongly varies with the angular orbital elements
the net amplitude (departing from some specific configurations) depends only weakly on these elements but strongly on the eccentricities As an application we illustrate how the formulae work for the weakly eccentric CoRoT-9b and the highly eccentric HD 80606b We consider also the question of detection as well as the correct identification of such perturbations
The first Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008 The Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument onboard Chandrayaan-1 consists of an energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging mass analyzer called CENA (Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutrals Analyzer) and an ion-mass analyzer called SWIM (Solar wind Monitor) CENA performed the first ever experiment to study the solar wind-planetary surface interaction via detection of sputtered neutral atoms and neutralized backscattered solar wind protons in the energy range ~0
SWIM measures solar wind ions magnetosheath and magnetotail ions as well as ions scattered from lunar surface in the ~0 01-15 keV energy range The neutral atom sensor uses conversion of the incoming neutrals to positive ions which are then analyzed via surface interaction technique The ion mass analyzer is based on similar principle
This paper presents the SARA instrument and the first results obtained by the SWIM and CENA sensors SARA observations suggest that about 20% of the incident solar wind protons are backscattered as neutral hydrogen and ~1% as protons from the lunar surface These findings have important implications for other airless bodies in the solar system
The carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in a planet provides critical information about its primordial origins and subsequent evolution A primordial C/O greater than 0 8 causes a carbide-dominated interior as opposed to a silicate-dominated composition as found on Earth and the atmospheres can also differ from those in the Solar System
The solar C/O is 0 54 Here we report an analysis of dayside multi-wavelength photometry of the transiting hot-Jupiter WASP-12b that reveals C/O &gt;= 1 in its atmosphere The atmosphere is abundant in CO It is depleted in water vapor and enhanced in methane by over two orders of magnitude each compared to a solar-abundance chemical-equilibrium model at the expected temperatures
We also find that the extremely irradiated atmosphere (T &gt; 2 500 K) of WASP-12b lacks a prominent thermal inversion or a stratosphere and has very efficient day- night energy circulation The absence of a strong thermal inversion is in stark contrast to theoretical predictions for the most highly irradiated hot-Jupiter atmospheres
The discovery of Jupiter-mass planets in close orbits about their parent stars has challenged models of planet formation Recent observations have shown that a number of these planets have highly inclined sometimes retrograde orbits about their parent stars prompting much speculation as to their origin It is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of these misaligned hot Jupiters
which suggests that dynamical processes after the gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed inclination and eccentricity distributions One particularly promising candidate is planet-planet scattering which is not very well understood in the non-linear regime of tides Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of multi-orbit encounters we show that planets that are scattered into an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being less than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or completely ejected from the system
We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18 of the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for scattering that lies well within the ice line implying that these planets must have migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to their current positions
If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\ast \gtrsim 10^7)$ disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters present in these systems Additionally we find that the disruption and/or ejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun&#39;s worth of angular momentum onto the host star For systems in which planet-planet scattering is common
We present the sub-mm/mm SED for a sample of eight young circumstellar disks in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula Cluster New observations were carried out at 2 9 mm with the CARMA array and for one disk 216-0939 at 3 3 and 6 8 mm with ATCA By combining these new millimeter data with literature measurements at sub-millimeter wavelengths we investigate grain growth and measure the dust mass in protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster
These data provide evidence for dust grain growth to at least millimeter-sizes for the first time in a high-mass star forming region The obtained range in sub-mm/mm spectral index namely 1 5-3 2 indicates that for disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (projected distance from the cluster center between about 0
We report the gravitational microlensing discovery of a sub-Saturn mass planet MOA-2009-BLG-319Lb orbiting a K or M-dwarf star in the inner Galactic disk or Galactic bulge The high cadence observations of the MOA-II survey discovered this microlensing event and enabled its identification as a high magnification event approximately 24 hours prior to peak magnification
As a result the planetary signal at the peak of this light curve was observed by 20 different telescopes which is the largest number of telescopes to contribute to a planetary discovery to date The microlensing model for this event indicates a planet-star mass ratio of q = (3 95 +/- 0
A Bayesian analysis based on the measured Einstein radius crossing time t_E and angular Einstein radius \theta_E along with a standard Galactic model indicates a host star mass of M_L = 0 38^{+0 34}_{-0 18} M_{Sun} and a planet mass of M_p = 50^{+44}_{-24} M_{Earth} which is half the mass of Saturn
This analysis also yields a planet-star three-dimensional separation of a = 2 4^{+1 2}_{-0 6} AU and a distance to the planetary system of D_L = 6 1^{+1 1}_{-1 2} kpc This separation is ~ 2 times the distance of the snow line a separation similar to most of the other planets discovered by microlensing
We present observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two exoplanetary systems revealing the orientations of their orbits relative to the rotation axes of their parent stars HAT-P-4b is prograde with a sky-projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = -4 9 +/- 11 9 degrees In contrast HAT-P-14b is retrograde with lambda = 189
These results conform with a previously noted pattern among the stellar hosts of close-in giant planets hotter stars have a wide range of obliquities and cooler stars have low obliquities This in turn suggests that three-body dynamics and tidal dissipation are responsible for the short-period orbits of many exoplanets In addition
We report the discovery of WASP-34b a sub-Jupiter-mass exoplanet transiting its 10 4-magnitude solar-type host star (1SWASP J110135 89-235138 4; TYC 6636-540-1) every 4 3177 days in a slightly eccentric orbit (e = 0 038 +/- 0 012) We find a planetary mass of 0 59 +/- 0 01 M_Jup and radius of 1
There is a linear trend in the radial velocities of 55+/-4 m/s/y indicating the presence of a long-period third body in the system with a mass &gt; 0 45 M_Jup at a distance of &gt;1 2 AU from the host star This third-body is either a low-mass star white dwarf
The Radiation Monitor (RADOM) payload is a miniature dosimeter-spectrometer onboard Chandrayaan-1 mission for monitoring the local radiation environment in near-Earth space and in lunar space RADOM measured the total absorbed dose and spectrum of the deposited energy from high energy particles in near-Earth space en-route and in lunar orbit RADOM was the first experiment to be switched on soon after the launch of Chandrayaan-1 and was operational till the end of the mission
A growing number (over 100 ) of extra-solar planets (ESPs) have been discovered by transit photometry and these systems are important because the transit strongly constrains their orbital inclination and allows accurate physical parameters for the planet to be derived especially their radii Their mass-radius relation allows us to probe their internal structure
In the present work we calculate Safronov numbers for the current sample of ESP and compare their masses and radii to current models with the goal of obtaining better constrains on their formation processe Our calculation of Safronov numbers for the current TESP sample does show 2 classes although about 20% lie above the formal Class I definition
These trends and recent results that argue against a useful distinction between Safronov classes are under further investigation Mass-radius relations for the current sample of TESP are inconsistent with ESP models with very large core masses (\geq 100 M\oplus) Most TESP with radii near 1RJ are consistent with models with no core mass or core masses of 10 M\oplus
The inflated planets with radii \geq 1 2 RJ are not consistent with current ESP models but may lie along the lower end of models for brown dwarfs Although such models are nascent it is important to establish trends for the current sample of ESP which will further the understanding of their formation and evolution
We observed the microlensing event MOA-2007-BLG-192 at high angular resolution in JHKs with the NACO adaptive optics system on the VLT while the object was still amplified by a factor 1 23 and then at baseline 18 months later We analyzed and calibrated the NACO photometry in the standard 2MASS system in order to accurately constrain the source and the lens star fluxes
We detect light from the host star of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb which significantly reduces the uncertainties in its char- acteristics as compared to earlier analyses We find that MOA-2007-BLG-192L is most likely a very low mass late type M-dwarf (0 084 [+0 015] [-0 012] M\odot) at a distance of 660 [+100] [-70] pc orbited by a 3
It has been proposed recently that the first step in the formation of both rocky and gas giant planets is dust sedimentation into a solid core inside a gas clump (giant planet embryo) The clumps are then assumed to migrate closer to the star where their metal poor envelopes are sheared away by the tidal forces or by an irradiation-driven mass loss
We consider the implications of this hypothesis for natal rotation rates of both terrestrial and gas giant planets It is found that both types of planets may rotate near their break up angular frequencies at birth The direction of the spin should coincide with that of the parent disc and the star
except in cases of embryos that had close interactions or mergers with other embryos in the past Furthermore the large repository of specific angular momentum at birth also allows formation of close binary rocky planets inside the same embryos We compare these predictions with rotation rates of planets in the Solar System and also question whether the Earth-Moon pair could have been formed within the same giant planet embryo
We used photometric data from the WASP (Wide-Angle Search for Planets) survey to explore the possibility of detecting eclipses and transit signals of brown dwarfs gas giants and terrestrial companions in close orbit around white dwarfs We performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations and we found that for Gaussian random noise WASP is sensitive to companions as small as the Moon orbiting a $V\sim$12 white dwarf
For fainter stars WASP is sensitive to increasingly larger bodies Our sensitivity drops in the presence of co-variant noise structure in the data nevertheless Earth-size bodies remain readily detectable in relatively low S/N data We searched for eclipses and transit signals in a sample of 194 white dwarfs in the WASP archive however
no evidence for companions was found We used our results to place tentative upper limits to the frequency of such systems While we can only place weak limits on the likely frequency of Earth-sized or smaller companions; brown dwarfs and gas giants (radius$\simeq$ R$_{jup}$) with periods $\leq$0 2 days must certainly be rare ($&lt;10\%$)
More stringent constraints requires significantly larger white dwarf samples higher observing cadence and continuous coverage The short duration of eclipses and transits of white dwarfs compared to the cadence of WASP observations appears to be one of the main factors limiting the detection rate in a survey optimised for planetary transits of main sequence stars
The large number of exoplanets found to orbit their host stars in very close orbits have significantly advanced our understanding of the planetary formation process It is now widely accepted that such short-period planets cannot have formed {\em in situ} but rather must have migrated to their current orbits from a formation location much farther from their host star
In the late stages of planetary formation once the gas in the proto-planetary disk has dissipated and migration has halted gas-giants orbiting in the inner disk regions will excite planetesimals and planetary embryos resulting in an increased rate of orbital crossings and large impacts We present the results of dynamical simulations for planetesimal evolution in this later stage of planet formation
M dwarfs constitute more than 70% of the stars in the solar neighborhood They are cooler and smaller than Sun-like stars and have less-massive disks which suggests that planets around these stars are more likely to be Neptune-size or smaller The transit depths and transit times of planets around M stars are large and well-matched to the Kepler temporal resolution
As a result M stars have been of particular interest for searching for planets in both radial velocity and transit photometry surveys We have recently started a project on searching for possible planet-hosting M stars in the publicly available data from Kepler space telescope We have used four criteria namely
the magnitude proper motion H-Ks and J-H colors and searched for M stars in Q0 and Q1 data sets We have been able to find 108 M stars among which 54 had not been previously identified among Kepler&#39;s targets We discuss the details of our selection process and present the results
Following Wolszczan&#39;s landmark discovery of planets in orbit around pulsar PSR B1257+12 in 1991 over 300 planets in more than 200 planetary systems have been found Therefore the meaning of Wolszczan&#39;s discovery cannot be overestimated In this paper we aim to convince the reader that the objects accompanying pulsar PSR B1257+12 are more exotic than thought so far
The field of exoplanets is quickly expanding from just the detection of new planets and the measurement of their most basic parameters such as mass radius and orbital configuration to the first measurements of their atmospheric characteristics such as temperature chemical composition albedo dynamics and structure Here I will overview some of the main findings on exoplanet atmospheres until September 2010
We report the discovery of a transiting planet orbiting the star TYC 2-1155-1 The star WASP-32 is a moderately bright (V=11 3) solar-type star (Teff=6100 +- 100K [Fe/H] = -0 13 +- 0 10) The lightcurve of the star obtained with the WASP-South and WASP-North instruments shows periodic transit-like features with a depth of about 1% and a duration of 0
The presence of a transit-like feature in the lightcurve is confirmed using z-band photometry obtained with Faulkes Telescope North High resolution spectroscopy obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph confirms the presence of a planetary mass companion From a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data assuming that the star is a typical main-sequence star
we estimate that the planet has a mass M_p = 3 60 +- 0 07 M_Jup and a radius R_p = 1 19 +- 0 06R_Jup WASP-32 is one of a small group of hot Jupiters with masses M_p &gt; 3M_Jup We find that some stars with hot Jupiter companions and with masses M_* =~ 1
The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is believed to be responsible for most of the angular momentum transport in accretion discs However molecular dissipation processes may drastically change the efficiency of MRI turbulence in realistic astrophysical situations The physical origin of this dependency is still poorly understood as linear and quasi linear theories fail to explain it
In this paper we look for the link between molecular dissipation processes and MRI transport of angular momentum in non stratified shearing box simulations including a mean vertical field We show that magnetic helicity is unimportant in the model we consider We perform a spectral analysis on the simulations tracking energy exchanges in spectral space when turbulence is fully developed
We find that the energy exchanges are essentially direct (from large to small scale) whereas some non linear interactions appear to be non local in spectral space We speculate that these non local interactions are responsible for the correlation between turbulent transport and molecular dissipation We argue that this correlation should then disappear when a significant scale separation is achieved and we discuss several methods by which one can test this hypothesis
The coupling of Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere and ionosphere plays a vital role in creating its auroral emissions The strength of these emissions is dependent on the difference in speed of the rotational flows within Jupiter&#39;s high-latitude thermosphere and the planet&#39;s magnetodisc Using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model we have simulated how upstream solar wind conditions affect the energy and direction of atmospheric flows
In order to simulate the effect of a varying dynamic pressure in the upstream solar wind we calculated three magnetic field profiles representing compressed averaged and expanded `middle&#39; magnetospheres These profiles were then used to solve for the angular velocity of plasma in the magnetosphere This angular velocity determines the strength of currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere
We examine the influence of variability in this current system upon the global winds and energy inputs within the Jovian thermosphere We find that the power dissipated by Joule heating and ion drag increases by ~190% and ~185% from our compressed to expanded model respectively We investigated the effect of exterior boundary conditions on our models and found that by reducing the radial current at the outer edge of the magnetodisc
We use SPH simulations with an approximate radiative cooling prescription to model evolution of a massive and large ($\sim 100$ AU) very young protoplanetary disc We also model dust growth and gas-grain dynamics with a second fluid approach It is found that the disc fragments onto a large number of $\sim 10$ Jupiter mass clumps that cool and contract slowly
Some of the clumps evolve onto eccentric orbits delivering them into the inner tens of AU where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star Dust grows and sediments inside the clumps displaying a very strong segregation with the largest particles forming dense cores in the centres The density of the dust cores may exceed that of the gas and is limited only by the numerical constraints
indicating that these cores should collapse into rocky planetary cores One particular giant planet embryo migrates inward close enough to be disrupted at about 10 AU leaving a self-bound solid core of about 7 5 $\mearth$ mass on a low eccentricity orbit at a radius of $\sim$ 8 AU These simulations support the recent suggestions that terrestrial and giant planets may be the remnants of tidally disrupted giant planet embryos
Genomic complexity can be used as a clock with which the moment in which life originated can be measured Some authors who have studied this problem have come to the conclusion that it is not possible that terrestrial life originated here and that in reality life originated giga-years ago before the solar system existed
If we accept this conclusion there is no other option than to admit that panspermia is something <a href="http //viable The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> goal of this study is to propose a viable hypothesis for the transport of SLF from one planetary system to another During the formation period of a planetary system giant planets can eject planets the size of the Earth
or larger turning them into free-floating planets in interstellar space These free-floating planets have also been called free floaters If a free floater which has developed life enters a lifeless planetary system it can seed the worlds of this system with SLF dragged by the stellar wind from one planet to another or by great impacts on the free planet
To support this hypothesis I calculate the probability that one free floater reaches the planets zone of a planetary system and also it was calculated the time it remains within the planetary zone in order to see if there is enough time to seed the host <a href="http //system The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> probability of a free floater in the galaxy
within the region of the Sun entering the planet zone of a system is 2 8x10-4 i e that {\sim}3 of 10 000 free planets manage to enter some planetary system At the galactocentric distance from the Sun I calculated that there are 21 495 free floaters floating around the galactic center
We report the discovery and initial characterisation of Qatar-1b a hot Jupiter orbiting a metal-rich K dwarf star the first planet discovered by the Alsubai Project exoplanet transit survey We describe the strategy used to select candidate transiting planets from photometry generated by the Alsubai Project instrument We examine the rate of astrophysical and other false positives found during the spectroscopic reconnaissance of the initial batch of candidates
A simultaneous fit to the follow-up radial velocities and photometry of Qatar-1b yield a planetary mass of 1 09+/-0 08 Mjup and a radius of 1 16+/-0 05 Rjup The orbital period and separation are 1 420033 days and 0 0234 AU for an orbit assumed to be circular The stellar density
Mean motion resonances are a common feature of both our own Solar System and of extrasolar planetary systems Bodies can be trapped in resonance when their orbital semi-major axes change for instance when they migrate through a protoplanetary disc We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the capture behaviour for first and second order resonances
Using this method all resonances of the same order can be described by one equation with applications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling We focus on the limit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive planet We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends on the relative migration rate of the planet and particle
and the particle&#39;s eccentricity Resonant capture fails for high migration rates and has decreasing probability for higher eccentricities More massive planets can capture particles at higher eccentricities and migration rates We also calculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for captured particles and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur
Libration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity The model allows for a complete description of a particle&#39;s behaviour as it successively encounters several resonances We discuss implications for several scenarios (i) Planet migration through gas discs trapping other planets or planetesimals in resonances (ii) Planet migration through a debris disc
(iii) Dust migration through PR drag The Hamiltonian model will allow quick interpretation of the resonant properties of extrasolar planets and Kuiper Belt Objects and will allow synthetic images of debris disc structures to be quickly generated which will be useful for predicting and interpreting disc images made with ALMA
Collisions resulting in fragmentation are important in shaping the mass spectrum of minor bodies in the asteroid belt the Kuiper belt and debris disks Models of fragmentation cascades typically find that in steady-state the solution for the particle mass distribution is a power law in the mass However previous studies have typically assumed that the mass of the largest fragment produced in a collision with just enough energy to shatter the target and disperse half its mass to infinity is directly proportional to the target mass
We show that if this assumption is not satisfied then the power law solution for the steady-state particle mass distribution is modified by a multiplicative factor which is a slowly varying function of the mass We derive analytic solutions for this correction factor and confirm our results numerically We find that this correction factor proves important when extrapolating over many orders of magnitude in mass
such as when inferring the number of large objects in a system based on infrared observations In the course of our work we have also discovered an unrelated type of non-power law behavior waves can persist in the mass distribution of objects even in the absence of upper or lower cutoffs to the mass distribution or breaks in the strength law
We present a re-analysis of archival HST/NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of three exoplanet systems; HD 189733 GJ-436 and XO-1 Detections of several molecules including H20 CH4 and CO2 have been claimed for HD 189733 and XO-1 but similarly sized features are attributed to systematic noise for GJ-436 The data consist of time-series grism spectra covering a planetary transit
After extracting light curves in independent wavelength channels we use a linear decorrelation technique account for instrumental systematics (which is becoming standard in the field) and measure the planet-to-star radius ratio as a function of wavelength For HD 189733 the uncertainties in the transmission spectrum are significantly larger than those previously reported
We also find the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when using different out-of-transit orbits to remove the systematics when some parameters are left out of the decorrelation procedure or when we perform the decorrelation with quadratic functions rather than linear functions Given that there is no physical reason to believe the baseline flux should be modelled as a linear function of any particular set of parameters
we interpret this as evidence that the linear decorrelation technique is not a robust method to remove systematic effects from the light curves for each wavelength channel For XO-1 the parameters measured to decorrelate the light curves would require extrapolation to the in-transit orbit to remove the systematics and we cannot reproduce the previously reported results
In a planetary system with two or more well-spaced eccentric inclined planets secular interactions may lead to chaos The innermost planet may gradually become very eccentric and/or inclined as a result of the secular degrees of freedom drifting towards equipartition of angular momentum deficit Secular chaos is known to be responsible for the eventual destabilization of Mercury in our own Solar System
Here we focus on systems with three giant planets We characterize the secular chaos and demonstrate the criterion for it to occur but leave a detailed understanding of secular chaos to a companion paper (Lithwick &amp; Wu 2010) After an extended period of eccentricity diffusion the inner planet&#39;s pericentre can approach the star to within a few stellar radii
Strong tidal interactions and ensuing tidal dissipation extracts orbital energy from the planet and pulls it inward creating a hot Jupiter In contrast to other proposed channels for the production of hot Jupiters such a scenario (which we term &#34;secular migration&#34;) explains a range of observations the pile-up of hot Jupiters at 3-day orbital periods
the fact that hot Jupiters are in general less massive than other RV planets that they may have misaligned inclinations with respect to stellar spin and that they have few easily detectable companions (but may have giant companions in distant orbits) Secular migration can also explain close-in planets as low in mass as Neptune; and an aborted secular migration can explain the &#34;warm Jupiters&#34; at intermediate distances
Reply to A Comment on The Far Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization - the Case for Interstellar Space Probess by Ian Crawford The paper The Far Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization resulted from the collective work of TE-SAT a team appointed by ESA in 2003 to assess a strategy to find and characterize Terrestrial Exoplanets
The interstellar flight aspect was not part of the TE-SAT work and was added afterward as side remarks in the chapter on « The Far Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization » As an introductory general remark the intention of the paper was not to discourage work on interstellar flight prospective
The chemical and physical evolution of primitive materials in protoplanetary disks are determined by the types of environments they are exposed to and their residence times within each environment Here a method for calculating representative paths of materials in diffusive protoplanetary disks is developed and applied to understanding how the vertical trajectories that particles take impact their overall evolution
The methods are general enough to be applied to disks with uniform diffusivity the so-called &#34;constant-$\alpha$&#34; cases and disks with a spatially varying diffusivity such as expected in &#34;layered-disks &#34; The average long-term dynamical evolution of small particles and gaseous molecules is independent of the specific form of the diffusivity in that they spend comparable fractions of their lifetimes at different heights in the disk
However the paths that individual particles and molecules take depend strongly on the form of the diffusivity leading to a different range of behavior of particles in terms of deviations from the mean As temperatures gas densities chemical abundances and photon fluxes will vary with height in protoplanetary disks the different paths taken by primitive materials will lead to differences in their chemical and physical evolution
We show that for a transiting exoplanet accompanied by a moon which also transits the absolute masses and radii of the star planet and moon are determinable For a planet-star system it is well known that the density of the star is calculable from the lightcurve by manipulation of Kepler&#39;s Third Law
In an analogous way the planetary density is calculable for a planet-moon system which transits a star and thus the ratio-of-densities is known By combining this ratio with the observed ratio-of-radii and the radial velocity measurements of the system we show that the absolute dimensions of the star and planet are determinable
Most main-belt asteroids are primitive rock and metal bodies in orbit about the Sun between Mars and Jupiter Disruption through high velocity collisions or rotational spin-up is believed to be the primary mechanism for the production and destruction of small asteroids and a contributor to dust in the Sun&#39;s Zodiacal cloud
while analogous collisions around other stars feed dust to their debris disks Unfortunately direct evidence about the mechanism or rate of disruption is lacking owing to the rarity of events Here we present observations of P/2010 A2 a previously unknown inner-belt asteroid with a peculiar comet-like morphology that is most likely the evolving remnant of a recent asteroidal disruption
We report the discovery of a transiting planet with an orbital period of 3 05d orbiting the star TYC 7247-587-1 The star WASP-41 is a moderately bright G8V star (V=11 6) with a metallicity close to solar ([Fe/H]=-0 08+-0 09) The star shows evidence of moderate chromospheric activity both from emission in the cores of the CaII H and K lines and photometric variability with a period of 18
We use a new method to show quantitatively that this periodic signal has a low false alarm probability The rotation period of the star implies a gyrochronological age for WASP-41 of 1 8Gyr with an error of about 15% We have used a combined analysis of the available photometric and spectroscopic data to derive the mass and radius of the planet (0
The precise location of the water ice condensation front (&#39;snow line&#39;) in the protosolar nebula has been a debate for a long time Its importance stems from the expected substantial jump in the abundance of solids beyond the snow line which is conducive to planet formation and from the higher stickiness in collisions of ice-coated dust grains
which may help the process of coagulation of dust and the formation of planetesimals In an optically thin nebula the location of the snow line is easily calculated to be around 3 AU However in its first 5 to 10 million years the solar nebula was optically thick implying a smaller snow line radius due to shielding from direct sunlight
but also a larger radius because of viscous heating Several models have attempted to treat these opposing effects However until recently treatments beyond an approximate 1+1D radiative transfer were unfeasible We revisit the problem with a fully self-consistent 3D treatment in an axisymmetric disk model including a density-dependent treatment of the dust and ice sublimation
We find that the location of the snow line is very sensitive to the opacities of the dust grains and the mass accretion rate of the disk We show that previous approximate treatments are quite efficient at determining the location of the snow line if the energy budget is locally dominated by viscous accretion
We derive an analytic estimate of the location of the snow line that compares very well with results from this and previous studies Using solar abundances of the elements we compute the abundance of dust and ice and find that the expected jump in solid surface density at the snow line is smaller than previously assumed
December Monocerotids and November Orionids are weak but established annual meteor showers active throughout November and December Analysis of a high quality orbits subset of the SonotaCo video meteor database shows that the distribution of orbital elements geocentric velocity and also the orbital evolution of the meteors and potential parent body may imply a common origin for these meteors coming from the parent comet C/1917 F1 Mellish
This is also confirmed by the physical properties and activity of these shower meteors An assumed release of meteoroids at the perihelion of the comet in the past and the sky-plane radiant distribution reveal that the December Monocerotid stream might be younger than the November Orionids A meteoroid transversal component of ejection velocity at the perihelion must be larger than 100 m/s
We study the interaction of atomic and molecular hydrogen with a surface of tholin a man-made polymer considered to be an analogue of aerosol particles present in Titan&#39;s atmosphere using thermal programmed desorption at low temperatures below 30 K The results are fitted and analyzed using a fine-grained rate equation model that describes the diffusion
reaction and desorption processes We obtain the energy barriers for diffusion and desorption of atomic and molecular hydrogen These barriers are found to be in the range of 30 to 60 meV indicating that atom/molecule-surface interactions in this temperature range are dominated by weak adsorption forces The implications of these results for the understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of Titan are discussed
Terrestrial planets with silicate mantles and metallic cores are likely to obtain water and carbon compounds during accretion Here I examine the conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous with cooling to clement surface conditions) and the timeline of degassing the planetary interior into the atmosphere
The greatest fraction of a planet&#39;s initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma ocean solidification leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism Rocky planets that accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an early water ocean
First if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass% of water in their bulk composition liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary surface at the end of magma ocean solidification Second at initial water contents as low as 0 01 mass% or lower during solidification a massive supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a water ocean upon cooling
It has been shown that an Earth-size planet or a super-Earth in resonance with a transiting Jupiter-like body in a short-period orbit around an M star can create detectable TTV signals (Kirste \&amp; Haghighipour 2011) Given the low masses of M stars and their circumstellar disks it is expected that such a transiting giant planet to have formed at large distances and migrated to its close-in orbit
That implies if such systems are discovered around M stars the terrestrial planet had to form during the migration of the giant planet The formation of this object may be either in-situ (in a close-in orbit) followed by its capture in resonance or the object is formed at larger distances where it was subsequently captured in a resonance with the migrating giant planet
We have investigated these two scenarios by simulating the dynamics of a disk of protoplanetary embryos and the formation of terrestrial planets during the migration of a Jupiter-like planet around an M star Results suggest that unless the migration of the giant planet is very slow (slower than 1E-7 AU/year)
it is unlikely that the close-in terrestrial planet is formed in-situ If a terrestrial planet is detected in a mean-motion resonance with a close-in giant planet around an M star the terrestrial planet was most likley formed at large distances and carried to its close-in resonant orbit by the migrating giant body
More than 450 stars hosting planets are known today but only approximately 30 planetary systems were discovered around stars beyond the Main Sequence The Penn State-Toruń Planet Search putting an emphasis on extending studies of planetary system formation and evolution to intermediate-mass stars is oriented towards the discoveries of substellar-mass companions to a large sample of evolved stars using high-precision radial velocity technique
We present the recent status of our survey and detailed characteristic for ~350 late type giant stars i e the new results of radial velocity analysis and stellar fundamental parameters obtained with extensive spectroscopic method Moreover in the future we will make an attempt to perform the statistical study of our sample and searching the correlations between the existence of substellar objects and stellar atmospheric parameters according to previous works which investigated the planetary companion impact on the evolution of the host stars
We present high-spectral-resolution optical spectra of the Herbig Be star MWC 147 in which we spectrally resolve several emission lines including the [O I] lines at 6300 and 6363° Their highly symmetric double-peaked line profiles indicate that the emission originates in a rotating circumstellar disk We deconvolve the Doppler-broadened [O I] emission lines to obtain a measure of emission as a function of distance from the central star
The resulting radial surface brightness profiles are in agreement with a disk structure consisting of a flat inner gaseous disk and a flared outer dust disk The transition between these components at 2 to 3 AU corresponds to the estimated dust sublimation radius The width of the double-peaked Mg II line at 4481°suggests that the inner disk extends to at least 0
Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main paradigms namely the core accretion model and the gravitational instability model These two formation scenarios support the hypothesis that the giant planet metallicities should be higher or equal to that of the parent star Meanwhile spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen abundances range from depleted to enriched with respect to the star
Here using a model describing the formation sequence and composition of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk we determine the range of volatile abundances in the envelope of HD189733b that is consistent with the 20--80 Earth-masses of heavy elements estimated to be present in the planet&#39;s envelope We then compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those retrieved from spectroscopy and we find a range of supersolar values that directly fit both spectra and internal structure models
In some cases we find that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar elemental abundances and the {mass of heavy elements predicted in HD189733b by internal structure models} can be explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers of the envelope
As part of the NASA EPOXI Mission of Opportunity we observed seven known transiting extrasolar planet systems in order to construct time series photometry of extremely high phase coverage and precision Here we present the results for four &#34;hot-Jupiter systems&#34; with near-solar stars - HAT-P-4 TrES-3 TrES-2 and WASP-3 We observe ten transits of HAT-P-4
estimating the planet radius Rp = 1 332 \pm 0 052 RJup the stellar radius R \star = 1 602 \pm 0 061 R \odot the inclination i = 89 67 \pm 0 30 degrees and the transit duration from first to fourth contact T = 255 6 \pm 1
For TrES-3 we observe seven transits and find Rp = 1 320 \pm 0 057 RJup R\star = 0 817 \pm 0 022 R\odot i = 81 99 \pm 0 30 degrees and T = 81 9 \pm 1 1 minutes We also note a long term variability in the TrES-3 light curve
which may be due to star spots We observe nine transits of TrES-2 and find Rp = 1 169 \pm 0 034 RJup R\star = 0 940 \pm 0 026 R\odot i = 84 15 \pm 0 16 degrees and T = 107 3 \pm 1 1 minutes Finally we observe eight transits of WASP-3

&#39;Empirical&#39; models (pressure vs density) of Uranus and Neptune interiors constrained by the gravitational coefficients J_2 J_4 the planetary radii and masses and Voyager solid-body rotation periods are presented The empirical pressure-density profiles are then interpreted in terms of physical equations of state of hydrogen helium ice (H_2O) and rock (SiO_2) to test the physical plausibility of the models
The compositions of Uranus and Neptune are found to be similar with somewhat different distributions of the high-Z material The big difference between the two planets is that Neptune requires a non-solar envelope while Uranus is best matched with a solar composition envelope Our analysis suggests that the heavier elements in both Uranus&#39; and Neptune&#39;s interior might increase gradually towards the planetary centers
Meteoritic data especially regarding chondrules and calcium-rich aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and isotopic evidence for short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) in the solar nebula potentially can constrain how planetary systems form Intepretation of these data demands an astrophysical model and the &#34;X-wind&#34; model of Shu et al (1996) and collaborators has been advanced to explain the origin of chondrules
CAIs and SLRs It posits that chondrules and CAIs were thermally processed &lt; 0 1 AU from the protostar then flung by a magnetocentrifugal outflow to the 2-3 AU region to be incorporated into chondrites Here we critically examine key assumptions and predictions of the X-wind model We find a number of internal inconsistencies
theory and observation show no solid material exists at 0 1 AU; particles at 0 1 AU cannot escape being accreted into the star; particles at 0 1 AU will collide at speeds high enough to destroy them; thermal sputtering will prevent growth of particles; and launching of particles in magnetocentrifugal outflows is not modeled
and may not be possible We also identify a number of incorrect predictions of the X-wind model the oxygen fugacity where CAIs form is orders of magnitude too oxidizing; chondrule cooling rates are orders of magnitude lower than those experienced by barred olivine chondrules; chondrule-matrix complementarity is not predicted; and the SLRs are not produced in their observed proportions
Examination of ambient thermodynamic conditions suggest that clathrate hydrates could exist in the martian permafrost on the surface and in the interior of Titan as well as in other icy satellites Clathrate hydrates probably formed in a significant fraction of planetesimals in the solar system Thus these crystalline solids may have been accreted in comets
in the forming giant planets and in their surrounding satellite systems In this work we use a statistical thermodynamic model to investigate the composition of clathrate hydrates that may have formed in the primordial nebula In our approach we consider the formation sequence of the different ices occurring during the cooling of the nebula
a reasonable idealization of the process by which volatiles are trapped in planetesimals We then determine the fractional occupancies of guests in each clathrate hydrate formed at given temperature The major ingredient of our model is the description of the guest-clathrate hydrate interaction by a spherically averaged Kihara potential with a nominal set of parameters
most of which being fitted on experimental equilibrium data Our model allows us to find that Kr Ar and N$_2$ can be efficiently encaged in clathrate hydrates formed at temperatures higher than $\sim$ 48 5 K in the primitive nebula instead of forming pure condensates below 30 K However we find at the same time that the determination of the relative abundances of guest species incorporated in these clathrate hydrates strongly depends on the choice of the parameters of the Kihara potential and also on the adopted size of cages
We evaluate the orbital evolution and several plausible origins scenarios for the mutually inclined orbits of Upsilon Andromedae c and d These two planets have orbital elements that oscillate with large amplitudes and lie close to the stability boundary This configuration and in particular the observed mutual inclination demands an explanation
The planetary system may be influenced by a nearby low-mass star Upsilon And B which could perturb the planetary orbits but we find it cannot modify two coplanar orbits into the observed mutual inclination of ~30 deg However it could incite ejections or collisions between planetary companions that subsequently raise the mutual inclination to &gt;30 deg
Our simulated systems with large mutual inclinations tend to be further from the stability boundary than Upsilon And but we are able to produce similar systems We conclude that scattering is a plausible mechanism to explain the observed orbits of Upsilon And c and d but we cannot determine whether the scattering was caused by instabilities among the planets themselves or by perturbations from Upsilon And B
The last several years have brought about a dynamic shift in the view of exoplanetary systems in the post-main sequence perhaps epitomized by the evidence for surviving rocky planetary bodies at white dwarfs Coinciding with the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope both space- and ground-based data have supported a picture whereby asteroid analogs persist at a significant fraction of cool white dwarfs
and are prone to tidal disruption when passing close to the compact stellar remnant The ensuing debris can produce a detectable infrared excess and the material gradually falls onto the star polluting the atmosphere with heavy elements that can be used to determine the bulk composition of the destroyed planetary body
Based on the observations to date the parent bodies inferred at white dwarfs are best described as asteroids and have a distinctly rocky composition similar to material found in the inner Solar System Their minimum masses are typical of large asteroids and can approach or exceed the mass of Vesta and Ceres
the two largest asteroids in the Solar System From the number of stars surveyed in various studies the fraction of white dwarfs that host terrestrial planetary system remnants is at least a few percent but likely to be in the range 20% to 30% Therefore A- and F-type stars form terrestrial planets efficiently
PTF/M-dwarfs is a 100 000-target M-dwarf planetary transit survey a Key Project of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) collaboration The survey is sensitive to Jupiter-radius planets around all of the target stars and has sufficient precision to reach Neptunes and super-Earths for the best targets The Palomar Transient Factory is a fully-automated
wide-field survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky The survey is performed using a new 7 26 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory Each 92-megapixel R-band exposure contains about 3 000 M-dwarfs usable for planet detection In each PTF observational season PTF/M-dwarfs searches for Jupiter-radius planets around almost 30
Neptune-radius planets around approximately 500 M-dwarfs and super-Earths around 100 targets The full survey is expected to cover more than 100 000 targets over the next several years Photometric and spectroscopic followup operations are performed on the Palomar 60-inch LCOGT Palomar 200-inch MDM and Keck telescopes The survey has been running since mid-2009
We observed VB 10 in August and September 2009 using the FORS2 camera of the VLT with the aim of measuring its astrometric motion and of probing the presence of the announced planet VB 10b We used the published STEPS astrometric positions of VB 10 over a time-span of 9 years
which allowed us to compare the expected motion of VB 10 due to parallax and proper motion with the observed motion and to compute precise deviations The achieved single-epoch precisions of our observations are about 0 1 mas and the data showed no significant residual trend while the presence of the planet should have induced an apparent proper motion larger than 10 mas/yr
Subtraction of the predicted orbital motion from the observed data produces a large trend in position residuals of VB 10 We estimated the probability that this trend is caused by random noise Taking all the uncertainties into account and using Monte-Carlo resampling of the data we are able to reject the existence of VB 10b with the announced mass of 6
Forming giant planets by disk instability requires a gaseous disk that is massive enough to become gravitationally unstable and able to cool fast enough for self-gravitating clumps to form and survive Models with simplified disk cooling have shown the critical importance of the ratio of the cooling to the orbital timescales
Uncertainties about the proper value of this ratio can be sidestepped by including radiative transfer Three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics models of a disk with a mass of $0 043 M_\odot$ from 4 to 20 AU in orbit around a $1 M_\odot$ protostar show that disk instabilities are considerably less successful in producing self-gravitating clumps than in a disk with twice this mass
The results are sensitive to the assumed initial outer disk ($T_o$) temperatures Models with $T_o$ = 20 K are able to form a single self-gravitating clump whereas models with $T_o$ = 25 K form clumps that are not quite self-gravitating These models imply that disk instability requires a disk with a mass of at least $\sim 0
The microlensing technique has found 10 exoplanets to date and promises to discover more in the near future While planetary transit light curves all show a familiar shape planetary perturbations to microlensing light curves can manifest a wide variety of morphologies We present a graphical guide that may be useful when understanding microlensing events showing planetary caustic perturbations
In this paper we modify Laskar&#39;s simplified model of planetary evolution and accretion [J Laskar Phys Rev Lett vol 84 p 3240 (2000)] to account for the full conservation of the total angular momentum of the system and extend it to incorporate an accretion probability that depends on the mass and relative velocity of the colliding particles
We present statistical results for the mass and eccentricity of the planets formed in terms of their semi-major axes for a large number of realisations of different versions of the model In particular we find that by combining the mass-dependent accretion probability and the velocity-selection mechanism the planets formed display a systematic occurrence at specific locations
We briefly report on a crater on the western slope of <a href="http //Mt Ararat" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> It is located in an area closed to foreigners at an altitude around 2100m with geographic coordinates 39°47&#39; 30&#34;N 44°14&#39; 40&#34;E The diameter of the crater is around 60-70m
We report the detection of a planetary companion around HIP 13044 a metal-poor red horizontal branch star belonging to a stellar halo stream that results from the disruption of an ancient Milky Way satellite galaxy The detection is based on radial velocity observations with FEROS at the 2 2-m MPG/ESO telescope
The periodic radial velocity variation of P=16 2 days can be distinguished from the periods of the stellar activity indicators We computed a minimum planetary mass of 1 25 Jupiter masses and an orbital semimajor axis of 0 116 AU for the planet This discovery is unique in three aspects
First it is the first planet detection around a star with a metallicity much lower than few percent of the solar value; second the planet host star resides in a stellar evolutionary stage that is still unexplored in the exoplanet surveys; third the planetary system HIP 13044 most likely has an extragalactic origin in a disrupted former satellite of the Milky Way
The Planetary and Lunar ephemerides INPOP10a version has several improvements in the fitting process the data sets used in the fit and in the general features of the solution No big change was brought in the dynamics As a consequence of these changes the extrapolation capabilities of INPOP10a are improved compared to INPOP08
High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown three giant planets Such images were possible due to the wide orbits (&gt; 25 AU) and youth (&lt; 100 Myr) of the imaged planets which are still hot and bright as they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation
A major area of contention in the extrasolar planet community is whether outer planets (&gt; 10 AU) more massive than Jupiter form via one-step gravitational instabilities or rather via a two-step process involving accretion of a core followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of hydrogen and helium
Here we report the presence of a fourth planet interior to and about the same mass as the other three The system with this additional planet represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets With its four young giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts
The orbital evolution of a dust particle under the action of a fast interstellar gas flow is investigated The secular time derivatives of Keplerian orbital elements and the radial transversal and normal components of the gas flow velocity vector at the pericentre of the particle&#39;s orbit are derived The secular time derivatives of the semi-major axis
eccentricity and of the radial transversal and normal components of the gas flow velocity vector at the pericentre of the particle&#39;s orbit constitute a system of equations that determines the evolution of the particle&#39;s orbit in space with respect to the gas flow velocity vector This system of differential equations can be easily solved analytically
From the solution of the system we found the evolution of the Keplerian orbital elements in the special case when the orbital elements are determined with respect to a plane perpendicular to the gas flow velocity vector Transformation of the Keplerian orbital elements determined for this special case into orbital elements determined with respect to an arbitrary oriented plane is presented
The orbital elements of the dust particle change periodically with a constant oscillation period or remain constant Planar perpendicular and stationary solutions are discussed <br>The applicability of this solution in the Solar system is also investigated We consider icy particles with radii from 1 to 10 micrometers The presented solution is valid for these particles in orbits with semi-major axes from 200 to 3000 AU and eccentricities smaller than 0
Using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description we develop a nonlinear dynamo model that couples the evolution of the large scale magnetic field with turbulent dynamics of the plasma at small scale by electromotive force (e m f ) in the induction equation at large scale The nonlinear behavior of the plasma at small scale is described by using a MHD shell model for velocity field and magnetic field <a href="http
//fluctuations The" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> shell model allow to study this problem in a large parameter regime which characterizes the dynamo phenomenon in many natural systems and which is beyond the power of supercomputers at today Under specific conditions of the plasma turbulent state the field fluctuations at small scales are able to trigger the dynamo instability
We study this transition considering the stability curve which shows a strong decrease in the critical magnetic Reynolds number for increasing inverse magnetic Prandlt number $\textrm{Pm}^{-1}$ in the range $[10^{-6} 1]$ and slows an increase in the range $[1 10^{8}]$ We also obtain hysteretic behavior across the dynamo boundary reveling the subcritical nature of this transition
The system undergoing this transition can reach different dynamo regimes depending on Reynolds numbers of the plasma flow This shows the critical role that the turbulence plays in the dynamo phenomenon In particular the model is able to reproduce the dynamical situation in which the large-scale magnetic field jumps between two states which represent the opposite polarities of the magnetic field
Approximately 2 8 Myr before the present our planet was subjected to the debris of a supernova explosion The terrestrial proxy for this event was the discovery of live atoms of 60Fe in a deep-sea ferromanganese crust The signature for this supernova event should also reside in magnetite Fe3O4 microfossils produced by magnetotactic bacteria extant at the time of the Earth-supernova interaction
provided the bacteria preferentially uptake iron from fine-grained iron oxides and ferric hydroxides Using estimates for the terrestrial supernova 60Fe flux combined with our empirically derived microfossil concentrations in a deep-sea drill core we deduce a conservative estimate of the ^{60}{Fe} fraction as 60Fe/Fe ~ 3 6 x 10^{-15} This value sits comfortably within the sensitivity limit of present accelerator mass spectrometry capabilities
This paper reports Very Large Array observations at 325 and 1425 MHz (90cm and 20cm) during and near the periastron passage of HD 80606b on 2007 November 20 We obtain flux density limits (3-sigma) of 1 7 mJy and 48 microJy at 325 and 1425 MHz respectively equivalent to planetary luminosity limits of 2
These are well above the Jovian value (at 40 MHz) of 2 x 10^{18} erg/s The motivation for these observations was that the planetary magnetospheric emission is driven by a stellar wind-planetary magnetosphere interaction so that the planetary luminosity would be elevated Near periastron HD 80606b might be as much as 3000 times more luminous than Jupiter
Recent transit observations of HD 80606b provide stringent constraints on the planetary mass and radius and because of the planet&#39;s highly eccentric orbit its rotation period is likely to be &#34;pseudo-synchronized&#34; to its orbital period allowing a robust estimate of the former We are able to make robust estimates of the emission frequency of the planetary magnetospheric emission and find it to be around 60--90 MHz
We compare HD 80606b to other high-eccentricity systems and assess the detection possibilities for both near-term and more distant future systems Of the known high eccentricity planets only HD 80606b is likely to be detectable as HD 20782B b and HD 4113b are both likely to have weaker magnetic field strengths
Both the forthcoming &#34;EVLA low band&#34; system and the Low Frequency Array may be able to improve upon our limits for HD 80606b and do so at a more optimum frequency If the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-lo) and a future lunar radio array are able to approach their thermal noise limits
We first establish a simple procedure to obtain with 11-figure accuracy the values of Chandrasekhar&#39;s H-function for isotropic scattering using a closed-form integral representation and the Gauss-Legendre quadrature Based on the numerical values of the function produced by this method for various values of the single scattering albedo and the cosine of the azimuth angle of the direction of radiation emergent from or incident upon a semi-infinite scattering-absorbing medium
We use three-dimensional simulations to study the atmospheric circulation on the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of an M star We treat Gliese 581g as a scaled-up version of Earth by considering increased values for the exoplanetary radius and surface gravity while retaining terrestrial values for parameters which are unconstrained by current observations
We examine the long-term global temperature and wind maps near the surface of the exoplanet --- the climate The specific locations for habitability on Gliese 581g depend on whether the exoplanet is tidally-locked and how fast radiative cooling occurs on a global scale Independent of whether the existence of Gliese 581g is confirmed
Context The K2V star eps Eri hosts one known inner planet an outer Kuiper belt analog and an inner disk of warm dust Spitzer/IRS measurements indicate that the warm dust is present at distances as close as a few AU from the star Its origin is puzzling since an &#34;asteroid belt&#34; that could produce this dust would be unstable because of the known inner planet
Aims Here we test the hypothesis that the observed warm dust is generated by collisions in the outer belt and is transported inward by Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag and strong stellar winds Methods We simulated a steady-state distribution of dust particles outside 10AU with a collisional code and in the inner region (r&lt;10AU) with single-particle numerical integrations
By assuming homogeneous spherical dust grains composed of water ice and silicate we calculated the thermal emission of the dust and compared it with observations We investigated two different orbital configurations for the inner planet inferred from RV measurements one with a highly eccentric orbit of e=0 7 and another one with a moderate one of e=0
We also produced a simulation without a planet Results Our models can reproduce the shape and magnitude of the observed SED from mid-IR to sub-mm wavelengths as well as the Spitzer/MIPS radial brightness profiles The best-fit dust composition includes both ice and silicates The results are similar for the two possible planetary orbits and without a planet
Conclusions The observed warm dust in the system can indeed stem from the outer belt and be transported inward by P-R and stellar wind drag The inner planet has little effect on the distribution of dust so that the planetary orbit could not be constrained Reasonable agreement between the model and observations can only be achieved by relaxing the assumption of purely silicate dust and assuming a mixture of silicate and ice in comparable amounts
An asymmetry between the ingress and egress times was observed in the near-UV light curve of the transit planet WASP-12b Such asymmetry led us to suggest that the early ingress in the UV light curve of WASP-12b compared to the optical observations is caused by a shock around the planet
and that shocks should be a common feature in transiting systems Here we classify all the transiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing shocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries We found that 36/92 of known transiting systems would lie above a reasonable detection threshold and that the most promising candidates to present shocks are
WASP-19b WASP-4b WASP-18b CoRoT-7b HAT-P-7b CoRoT-1b TrES-3 and WASP-5b For prograde planets orbiting outside the co-rotation radius of fast rotating stars the shock position instead of being ahead of the planetary motion as in WASP-12b trails the planet In this case we predict that the light curve of the planet should present a late-egress asymmetry
We show that CoRoT-11b is a potential candidate to host such a behind shock and show a late egress If observed these asymmetries can provide constraints on planetary magnetic fields For instance for a planet that has a magnetic field intensity similar to Jupiter&#39;s field (~ 14 G) orbiting a star whose magnetic field is between 1 and 100G
We simulate a Kepler-like observation of a theoretical exoplanet population and we show that the observed orbital period distribution of the Kepler giant planet candidates is best matched by an average stellar specific dissipation function Q_* in the interval 10^6 ~&lt; Q_* ~&lt; 10^7 In that situation the few super-Earths that are driven to orbital periods P &lt; 1 day by dynamical interactions in multiple-planet systems will survive tidal disruption for a significant fraction of the main-sequence lifetimes of their stellar hosts
Consequently though these very-hot super-Earths are not characteristic of the overall super-Earth population their substantial transit probability implies that they should be significant contributors to the full super-Earth population uncovered by Kepler As a result the CoRoT-7 system may be the first representative of a population of very-hot super-Earths that we suggest should be found in multiple-planet systems preferentially orbiting the least-dissipative stellar hosts in the Kepler sample
Hot-Jupiter planets must form at large separations from their host stars where the temperatures are cool enough for their cores to condense They then migrate inwards to their current observed orbital separations Different theories of how this migration occurs lead to varying distributions of orbital eccentricity and the alignment between the rotation axis of the star and the orbital axis of the planet
The spin-orbit alignment of a transiting system is revealed via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect which is the anomaly present in the radial velocity measurements of the rotating star during transit due to the planet blocking some of the starlight In this paper we aim to measure the spin-orbit alignment of the WASP-3 system via a new way of analysing the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations
We apply a new tomographic method for analysing the time variable asymmetry of stellar line profiles caused by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect This new method eliminates the systematic error inherent in previous methods used to analyse the effect We find a value for the projected stellar spin rate of v sin i = 13
Several studies in the recent past have inferred the existence of thermal inversions in some transiting hot Jupiter atmospheres Given the limited data available the inference of a thermal inversion depends critically on the chemical composition assumed for the atmosphere In this study we explore the degeneracies between thermal inversions and molecular abundances in four highly irradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres
day-side observations of which were previously reported to be consistent with thermal inversions based on Spitzer photometry The four systems are HD 209458b HAT-P-7b TrES-4 and TrES-2 For each system we explore the model parameter space with ~ 10^6 models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo routine Our results primarily suggest that a thorough exploration of the model parameter space is necessary to identify thermal inversions in hot Jupiter atmospheres
We find that existing observations of TrES-4 and TrES-2 can both be fit very precisely with models with and without thermal inversions and with a wide range in chemical composition On the other hand observations of HD 209458b and HAT-P-7b are better fit with thermal inversions than without as has been reported before
We give an alternative description of the data produced in the KamLAND experiment assuming the existence of a natural nuclear reactor on the boundary of the liquid and solid phases of the Earth&#39;s core Analyzing the uncertainty of antineutrino spectrum of georeactor origin we show that the theoretical (which takes into account the soliton-like nuclear georeactor) total reactor antineutrino spectra describe with good accuracy the experimental KamLAND-data over the years of 2002-2007 and 2002-2009
respectively At the same time the parameters of mixing ({\Delta}(m21)^2=2 5\cdot 10^-5 eV^2 tan^2{\theta}12=0 437) calculated within the framework of georeactor hypothesis substantially differ from the parameters of mixing ({\Delta}(m21)^2=7 49\cdot 10^-5 eV^2 tan^2{\theta}12=0 436) obtained in KamLAND-experiment for total exposure over the period of 2002-2009 By traingulation of KamLAND and Borexino data we have constructed the coordinate location of soliton-like nuclear georeactors on the boundary of the liquid and solid phases of the Earth core
Based on the necessary condition of full synchronization of geological (magnetic) time scale and time evolution of heat power of nuclear georeactor which plays the role of energy source of the Earth magnetic field and also the strong negative correlation between magnetic field of the solar tachocline zone and magnetic field of the Earth liquid core (Y-component) we have obtain the estimation of nuclear georeactor average heat power ~30 TW over the years 2002-2009
Titan is one of the more distinctive bodies in our solar system In addition to being the largest of Saturn&#39;s moons its thick atmosphere gene-rates interest because of its similarities and differences with Earth [1 2] Like Earth Titan&#39;s lower atmosphere contains clouds which precipitate as rain [2] This rain forms lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane which erode and shape the surface
A review of non-local deep transport mechanisms in the atmosphere of Earth provides a good foundation for examining whether similar mechanisms are operating in the atmospheres of Mars and Titan On Earth deep convective clouds in the tropics constitute the upward branch of the Hadley Cell and provide a conduit through which energy
moisture momentum aerosols and chemical species are moved from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere This transport produces mid-tropospheric minima in quantities such as water vapor and moist static energy and maxima where the clouds detrain Analogs to this terrestrial transport are found in the strong and deep thermal circulations associated with topography on Mars and with Mars dust storms
Observations of elevated dust layers on Mars further support the notion that non-local deep transport is an important mechanism in the atmosphere of Mars On Titan the presence of deep convective clouds almost assures that non-local deep transport is occurring and these clouds may play a role in global cycling of energy
Photometric follow-ups of transiting exoplanets (TEPs) may lead to discoveries of additional less massive bodies in extrasolar systems This is possible by detecting and then analysing variations in transit timing of transiting exoplanets In 2009 we launched an international observing campaign the aim of which is to detect and characterise signals of transit timing variation (TTV) in selected TEPs
The Anglo-Australian Planet Search has now accumulated 12 years of radial-velocity data with long-term instrumental precision better than 3 m/s In this paper we expand on earlier simulation work to probe the frequency of near-circular long-period gas-giant planets residing at orbital distances of 3-6 AU -- the so-called &#34;Jupiter analogs
We investigate numerically kinematic dynamos driven by flow of electrically conducting fluid in the shell between two concentric differentially rotating spheres a configuration normally referred to as spherical Couette flow We compare between axisymmetric (2D) and fully three dimensional flows between low and high global rotation rates between prograde and retrograde differential rotations
between weak and strong nonlinear inertial forces between insulating and conducting boundaries and between two aspect ratios The main results are as follows Azimuthally drifting Rossby waves arising from the destabilisation of the Stewartson shear layer are crucial to dynamo action Differential rotation and helical Rossby waves combine to contribute to the spherical Couette dynamo
At a slow global rotation rate the direction of differential rotation plays an important role in the dynamo because of different patterns of Rossby waves in prograde and retrograde flows At a rapid global rotation rate stronger flow supercriticality (namely the difference between the differential rotation rate of the flow and its critical value for the onset of nonaxisymmetric instability) facilitates the onset of dynamo action
We present a new short-period brown dwarf candidate around the star TYC 1240-00945-1 This candidate was discovered in the first year of the Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanets Large-area Survey (MARVELS) which is part of the third phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) and we designate the brown dwarf as MARVELS-1b
MARVELS uses the technique of dispersed fixed-delay interferometery to simultaneously obtain radial velocity measurements for 60 objects per field using a single custom-built instrument that is fiber fed from the SDSS 2 5-m telescope From our 20 radial velocity measurements spread over a ~370 d time baseline we derive a Keplerian orbital fit with semi-amplitude K=2
period P=5 8953+/-0 0004 d and eccentricity consistent with circular Independent follow-up radial velocity data confirm the orbit Adopting a mass of 1 37+/-0 11 M_Sun for the slightly evolved F9 host star we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of 28 0+/-1 5 M_Jup a semimajor axis 0
and is probably tidally synchronized We find no evidence for coherent instrinsic variability of the host star at the period of the companion at levels greater than a few millimagnitudes The companion has an a priori transit probability of ~14% Although we find no evidence for transits we cannot definitively rule them out for companion radii ~&lt;1 R_Jup
We investigate the current sample of exoplanet spin-orbit measurements to determine whether a dominant planet migration channel can be identified and at what confidence We use the predictions of Kozai migration plus tidal friction (Fabrycky and Tremaine 2007) and planet-planet scattering (Nagasawa et al 2008) as our misalignment models and we allow for a fraction of intrinsically aligned systems
explainable by disk migration Bayesian model comparison demonstrates that the current sample of 32 spin-orbit measurements strongly favors a two-mode migration scenario combining planet-planet scattering and disk migration over a single-mode Kozai migration scenario Our analysis indicates that between 34% and 76% of close-in planets (95% confidence) migrated via planet-planet scattering
Separately analyzing the subsample of 12 stars with T_eff &gt; 6250 K---which Winn et al (2010) predict to be the only type of stars to maintain their primordial misalignments---we find that the data favor a single-mode scattering model over Kozai with 81% confidence We also assess the number of additional hot star spin-orbit measurements that will likely be necessary to provide a more confident model selection
finding that an additional 20-30 measurements has a &gt;50% chance of resulting in a 95%-confident model selection if the current model selection is correct While we test only the predictions of particular Kozai and scattering migration models in this work our methods may be used to test the predictions of any other spin-orbit misaligning mechanism
We present photometry of the giant extrasolar planet WASP-4b at 3 6 and 4 5 micron taken with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of Spitzer&#39;s extended warm mission We find secondary eclipse depths of 0 319+/-0 031% and 0 343+/-0 027% for the 3
respectively and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profiles for the planetary atmosphere These eclipse depths are well fit by model emission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption similar to those used for TrES-3 and HD 189733b Depending on our choice of model these results indicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or no inversion at all
The absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highly irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are expected to have inversions perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in the upper atmosphere This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced activity level of WASP-4b&#39;s G7V host star
which could increase the amount of UV flux received by the planet therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et al (2010) We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0
Three transiting exoplanet candidate stars were discovered in a ground-based photometric survey prior to the launch of NASA&#39;s {\it Kepler} mission {\it Kepler} observations of them were obtained during Quarter 1 of the {\it Kepler} mission All three stars are faint by radial velocity follow-up standards so we have examined these candidates with regard to eliminating false positives and providing high confidence exoplanet selection
We present a first attempt to exclude false positives for this set of faint stars without high resolution radial velocity analysis This method of exoplanet confirmation will form a large part of the {\it Kepler} mission follow-up for Jupiter-sized exoplanet candidates orbiting faint stars Using the {\it Kepler} light curves and pixel data
as well as medium resolution reconnaissance spectroscopy and speckle imaging we find that two of our candidates are binary stars One consists of a late-F star with an early M companion while the other is a K0 star plus a late M-dwarf/brown dwarf in a 19-day elliptical orbit The third candidate (BOKS-1) is a $r$=15 G8V star hosting a newly discovered exoplanet with a radius of 1
Recently we presented the detection of carbon monoxide in the transmission spectrum of extrasolar planet HD209458b using CRIRES the Cryogenic high-resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph at ESO&#39;s Very Large Telescope (VLT) The high spectral resolution observations (R=100 000) provide a wealth of information on the planet&#39;s orbit mass composition and even on its atmospheric dynamics
The new observational strategy and data analysis techniques open up a whole world of opportunities We therefore started an ESO large program using CRIRES to explore these targeting both transiting and non-transiting planets in carbon monoxide water vapour and methane Observations of the latter molecule will also serve as a test-bed for METIS
Significant proton fluxes were detected in the near wake region of the Moon by an ion mass spectrometer on board Chandrayaan-1 The energy of these nightside protons is slightly higher than the energy of the solar wind protons The protons are detected close to the lunar equatorial plane at a $140^{\circ}$ solar zenith angle
i e ~50$^{\circ}$ behind the terminator at a height of 100 km The protons come from just above the local horizon and move along the magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame We compared the observed proton flux with the predictions from analytical models of an electrostatic plasma expansion into a vacuum
Mean motion resonances are a common feature of both our own Solar System and of extrasolar planetary systems Bodies can be trapped in resonance when their orbital semi-major axes change for instance when they migrate through a protoplanetary disc We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the capture behaviour for first and second order resonances
Using this method all resonances of the same order can be described by one equation with applications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling We focus on the limit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive planet We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends on the relative migration rate of the planet and particle
and the particle&#39;s eccentricity Resonant capture fails for high migration rates and has decreasing probability for higher eccentricities although for certain migration rates capture probability peaks at a finite eccentricity We also calculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for captured particles and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur
Libration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity The model allows for a complete description of a particle&#39;s behaviour as it successively encounters several resonances The model is applicable to many scenarios including (i) Planet migration through gas discs trapping other planets or planetesimals in resonances; (ii) Planet migration through a debris disc; (iii) Dust migration through PR drag
Near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) is a potential flyby and rendezvous target for interplanetary missions because of its easy to reach orbit The physical and thermal properties of the asteroid are relevant for establishing the scientific mission goals and also important in the context of near-Earth object studies in general
Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such as shape spin-vector size geometric albedo and surface properties of 162173 (1999 JU3) With three sets of published thermal observations (ground-based N-band Akari IRC Spitzer IRS) we applied a thermophysical model to derive the radiometric properties of the asteroid The calculations were performed for the full range of possible shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the available sample of visual lightcurve observations
The near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) has an effective diameter of 0 87 +/- 0 03 km and a geometric albedo of 0 070 +/- 0 006 The chi2-test reveals a strong preference for a retrograde sense of rotation with a spin-axis orientation of lambda_ecl = 73 deg beta_ecl = -62 deg and P_sid = 7
The most likely thermal inertia ranges between 200 and 600 Jm-2s-0 5K-1 about a factor of 2 lower than the value for 25143 Itokawa This indicates that the surface lies somewhere between a thick-dust regolith and a rock/boulder/cm-sized gravel-dominated surface like that of 25143 Itokawa Our analysis represents the first time that shape and spin-vector information has been derived from a combined data set of visual lightcurves (reflected light) and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy (thermal emission)
The detection of increased sodium absorption during primary transit implies the presence of an atmosphere around an extrasolar planet and enables us to infer the structure of this atmosphere Sodium has only been detected in the atmospheres of two planets to date - HD189733b and HD209458b WASP-17b is the least dense planet currently known
It has a radius approximately twice that of Jupiter and orbits an F6-type star The transit signal is expected to be about five times larger than that observed in HD209458b We obtained 24 spectra with the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the VLT eight during transit The integrated flux in the sodium doublet at wavelengths 5889
and 6 0 Å We find a transit depth of 0 55 \pm 0 13 per cent at 1 5 Å This suggests that like HD209458b WASP-17b has an atmosphere depleted in sodium compared to models for a cloud-free atmosphere with solar sodium abundance We observe a sharp cut-off in sodium absorption between 3
We present new precise HIRES radial velocity (RV) data sets of five nearby stars obtained at Keck Observatory HD 31253 HD 218566 HD 177830 HD 99492 and HD 74156 are host stars of spectral classes F through K and show radial velocity variations consistent with new or additional planetary companions in Keplerian motion
The orbital parameters of the candidate planets in the five planetary systems span minimum masses of M sin i = 27 43 M_{earth} to M sin i = 8 28 M_{jup} periods of 17 05 to 4696 95 days and eccentricities ranging from circular to extremely eccentric (e ~ 0
The 5th star HD 74156 was known to have both a 52-day and a 2500-day planet and was claimed to also harbor a 3rd planet at 336d in apparent support of the &#34;Packed Planetary System&#34; hypothesis Our greatly expanded data set for HD 74156 provides strong confirmation of both the 52-day and 2500-d planets
Candidate transiting planet systems discovered by wide-field ground-based surveys must go through an intensive follow-up procedure to distinguish the true transiting planets from the much more common false positives Especially pernicious are configurations of three or more stars which produce radial velocity and light curves that are similar to those of single stars transited by a planet
Context Low-mass extrasolar planets are presently being discovered at an increased pace by radial velocity and transit surveys opening a new window on planetary systems Aims We are conducting a high-precision radial velocity survey with the HARPS spectrograph which aims at characterizing the population of ice giants and super-Earths around nearby solar-type stars
This will lead to a better understanding of their formation and evolution and yield a global picture of planetary systems from gas giants down to telluric planets Methods Progress has been possible in this field thanks in particular to the sub-m/s radial velocity precision achieved by HARPS We present here new high-quality measurements from this instrument
Results We report the discovery of a planetary system comprising at least five Neptune-like planets with minimum masses ranging from 12 to 25 M_Earth orbiting the solar-type star HD 10180 at separations between 0 06 and 1 4 AU A sixth radial velocity signal is present at a longer period
probably due to a 65-M_Earth object Moreover another body with a minimum mass as low as 1 4 M_Earth may be present at 0 02 AU from the star This is the most populated exoplanetary system known to date The planets are in a dense but still well-separated configuration with significant secular interactions
Some of the orbital period ratios are fairly close to integer or half-integer values but the system does not exhibit any mean-motion resonances General relativity effects and tidal dissipation play an important role to stabilize the innermost planet and the system as a whole Numerical integrations show long-term dynamical stability provided true masses are within a factor ~3 from minimum masses
Since the 1980&#39;s it has been becoming increasingly clear that the Solar System&#39;s irregular satellites are collisionally evolved We derive a general model for the collisional evolution of an irregular satellite swarm and apply it to the Solar System and extrasolar planets Our model reproduces the Solar System&#39;s complement of observed irregulars well
and suggests that the competition between grain-grain collisions and Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag helps set the fate of the dust Because swarm collision rates decrease over time the main dust sink can change with time and may help unravel the accretion history of synchronously rotating regular satellites that show brightness asymmetries
Some level of dust must be present on AU scales around the Solar System&#39;s giant planets which we predict may be at detectable levels We also predict whether dust produced by extrasolar circumplanetary swarms can be detected The coronagraphic instruments on JWST will have the ability to detect the dust generated by these swarms
which are most detectable around planets that orbit at tens of AU from the youngest stars Because the collisional decay of swarms is relatively insensitive to planet mass swarms can be much brighter than their host planets and allow discovery of Neptune-mass planets that would otherwise remain invisible This dust may have already been detected
The observations of the planet Fomalhaut b can be explained as scattered light from dust produced by the collisional decay of an irregular satellite swarm around a 10 Earth-mass planet Such a swarm comprises about 5 Lunar masses worth of irregular satellites Finally we consider what happens if Fomalhaut b passes through Fomalhaut&#39;s main debris ring
The Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has produced for the first time an image of a lunar magnetic anomaly in backscattered hydrogen atoms The image shows that a partial void of the solar wind a mini-magnetosphere is formed above the strong magnetic anomaly near the Crisium antipode
The mini-magnetosphere is 360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300-km-thick region of enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the mini-magnetosphere The mini-magnetosphere is visible only in hydrogen atoms with energy exceeding 150 eV Fluxes with energies below 100 eV do not show corresponding spatial variations
A Monte Carlo model has been developed to study the degradation of &lt;1000 eV electrons in an atmosphere of CO2 which is one of the most abundant species in Mars&#39; and Venus&#39; atmospheres The e-CO2 cross sections are presented in an assembled set along with their analytical representations Monte Carlo simulations are carried out at several energies to calculate the &#34;yield spectra&#34;
which embodied all the information related to electron degradation process and can be used to calculate &#34;yield&#34; (or population) for any inelastic process The numerical yield spectra have been fitted analytically resulting in an analytical yield spectra (AYS) We have calculated the mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies for various inelastic processes
including the double and dissociative double ionization of \car\ and negative ion formation The energy distribution of the secondary electrons produced per incident electron is also presented at few incident energies The mean energy per ion pair for CO2 is 37 5 (35 8) eV at 200 (1000) eV compared to experimental value 32
Ionization is the dominant loss process at energies above 50 eV with contribution of ~50% Among the excitation processes 13 6 eV and 12 4 eV states are the dominant loss processes consuming ~28% energy above 200 eV Around and below ionization threshold 13 6 eV 12 4 eV and 11
Spectrographs like HARPS can now reach a sub-m/s precision in radial-velocity (RV) (Pepe &amp; Lovis 2008) At this level of accuracy we start to be confronted with stellar noise produced by 3 different physical phenomena oscillations granulation phenomena (granulation meso- and super-granulation) and activity On solar type stars these 3 types of perturbation can induce m/s RV variation
but on different time scales 3 to 15 minutes for oscillations 15 minutes to 1 5 days for granulation phenomena and 10 to 50 days for activity The high precision observational strategy used on HARPS 1 measure per night of 15 minutes on 10 consecutive days each month is optimized
due to a long exposure time to average out the noise coming from oscillations (Dumusque et al 2010) but not to reduce the noise coming from granulation and activity The smallest planets found with this strategy (Mayor et al 2009) seems to be at the limit of the actual observational strategy and not at the limit of the instrumental precision
We present mid-infrared spectra and images from the GEMINI-N (+Michelle) observations of fragments SW3-[B] and SW3-[C] of the ecliptic (Jupiter Family) comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 pre-perihelion We observed fragment B soon after an outburst event (between 2006 April 16 - 26 UT) and detected crystalline silicates The mineralogy of both fragments was dominated by amorphous carbon and amorphous pyroxene
The grain size distribution (assuming a Hanner modified power-law) for fragment SW3-[B] has a peak grain radius of a_p ~ 0 5 micron and for fragment SW3-[C] a_p ~ 0 3 micron; both values larger than the peak grain radius of the size distribution for the dust ejected from ecliptic comet 9P/Tempel 1 during the Deep Impact event (a_p = 0
The silicate-to-carbon ratio and the silicate crystalline mass fraction for the submicron to micron-size portion of the grain size distribution on the nucleus of fragment SW3-[B] was 1 341 +0 250 -0 253 and 0 335 +0 089 -0 112 respectively while on the nucleus of fragment SW3-[C] was 0
respectively The similarity in mineralogy and grain properties between the two fragments implies that 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is homogeneous in composition The slight differences in grain size distribution and silicate-to-carbon ratio between the two fragments likely arises because SW3-[B] was actively fragmenting throughout its passage while the activity in SW3-[C] was primarily driven by jets
The lack of diverse mineralogy in the fragments SW3-[B] and SW3-[C] of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 along with the relatively larger peak in the coma grain size distribution suggests the parent body of this comet may have formed in a region of the solar nebula with different environmental properties than the natal sites where comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and 9P/Tempel 1 nuclei aggregated
We present observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the transiting exoplanet systems WASP-1 WASP-24 WASP-38 and HAT-P-8 and deduce the orientations of the planetary orbits with respect to the host stars&#39; rotation axes The planets WASP-24b WASP-38b and HAT-P-8b appear to move in prograde orbits and be well aligned having sky-projected spin orbit angles consistent with zero
{\lambda} = -4 7 \pm 4 0° {\lambda} = 15 + 33°/-43° and {\lambda} = -9 7 +9 0°/-7 7° respectively The host stars have Teff &lt; 6250 K and conform with the trend of cooler stars having low obliquities WASP-38b is a massive planet on a moderately long period
eccentric orbit so may be expected to have a misaligned orbit given the high obliquities measured in similar systems However we find no evidence for a large spin-orbit angle By contrast WASP-1b joins the growing number of misaligned systems and has an almost polar orbit {\lambda} = -79 +4 5°/-4
We present a measurement of the lifetime of ground state atomic carbon C(^3P) against ionization processes in interplanetary space and compare it to the lifetime expected from the dominant physical processes likely to occur in this medium Our measurement is based on analysis of a far ultraviolet (FUV) image of comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) recorded by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) on 2005 March 1
The bright CI 1561 A and 1657 A multiplets dominate the GALEX FUV band We used the image to create high S/N radial profiles that extended beyond one million km from the comet nucleus Our measurements yielded a total carbon lifetime of 7 1 -- 9 6 x 10^5 s (scaled to 1 AU)
Which compares favorably to calculations assuming solar photoionization solar wind proton change exchange and solar wind electron impact ionization are the dominant processes occurring in this medium and that comet Machholz was embedded in the slow solar wind The shape of the CI profiles inside 3x10^5 km suggests that either the CO lifetime is shorter than previously thought and/or a shorter-lived carbon-bearing parent molecule
In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and higher the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth regime cannot be uniquely determined from a mass and radius measurement alone For these planets there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models
The recently discovered transiting super-Earth GJ1214b is one example of this problem Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested and breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet&#39;s atmospheric composition Here we report a ground-based measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ1214b between 780 and 1000 nm
The lack of features in this spectrum rules out cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen at 4 9 sigma confidence If the planet&#39;s atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200 mbar Alternatively the featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense water vapor atmosphere
SARA experiment aboard the first Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 had the objective to explore the solar wind-lunar interaction using energetic neutral atoms (ENA) from the lunar surface as diagnostic tool SARA consisted of an ENA imaging mass analyzer CENA (Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer) and an ion mass analyser SWIM (Solar Wind Monitor)
along with a digital processing unit (DPU) which commands and controls the sensors and provides the interface to the spacecraft Both sensors have provided excellent observational data CENA has observed ENAs from the lunar surface and found that ~20% of the incident solar wind ions get backscattered as ENAs from the lunar surface
Planetary migration is essential to explain the observed mass-period relation for exoplanets Without some stopping mechanism the tidal resonant interaction between planets and their gaseous disc generally causes the planets to migrate inward so efficiently that they plunge into the host star within the gaseous disc lifetime ($\sim $ 1-3 Myrs)
We investigate planetary migration by analytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently computed radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust settling are included We show that dust settling lowers the disc temperature and raises the gas density in the mid-plane This inescapable evolution of disc structure speeds up type I planetary migration for lower mass bodies by up to a factor of about 2
We also examine the effects of dust settling on the gap-opening mass and type II migration and find that the gap-opening mass is reduced by a factor of 2 and type II migration becomes slower by a factor of 2 While dust settling can somewhat alleviate the problem of planetary migration for more massive planets
We present 11 years of HIRES precision radial velocities (RV) of the nearby M3V star Gliese 581 combining our data set of 122 precision RVs with an existing published 4 3-year set of 119 HARPS precision RVs The velocity set now indicates 6 companions in Keplerian motion around this star
Differential photometry indicates a likely stellar rotation period of ~94 days and reveals no significant periodic variability at any of the Keplerian periods supporting planetary orbital motion as the cause of all the radial velocity variations The combined data set strongly confirms the 5 37-day 12 9-day 3 15-day and 67-day planets previously announced by Bonfils et al
(2005) Udry et al (2007) and Mayor et al (2009) The observations also indicate a 5th planet in the system GJ 581f a minimum-mass 7 0 M_Earth planet orbiting in a 0 758 AU orbit of period 433 days and a 6th planet GJ 581g a minimum-mass 3 1 M_Earth planet orbiting at 0
The estimated equilibrium temperature of GJ 581g is 228 K placing it squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star and offering a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet around a very nearby star That a system harboring a potentially habitable planet has been found this nearby
and this soon in the relatively early history of precision RV surveys indicates that eta_Earth the fraction of stars with potentially habitable planets is likely to be substantial This detection coupled with statistics of the incompleteness of present-day precision RV surveys for volume-limited samples of stars in the immediate solar neighborhood suggests that eta_Earth could well be on the order of a few tens of percent
One of the first stages of planet formation is the growth of small planetesimals and their accumulation into large planetesimals and planetary embryos This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the gas from the protoplanetary disk Due to their different aerodynamic properties planetesimals of different sizes/shapes experience different drag forces from the gas at these stage
Such differential forces produce a wind-shearing effect between close by different size planetesimals For any two planetesimals a wind-shearing radius can be considered at which the differential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual gravitational pull between the planetesimals We find that the wind-shearing radius could be much smaller than the gravitational shearing radius by the Sun (the Hill radius)
i e during the gas-phase of the disk wind-shearing could play a more important role than tidal perturbations by the Sun Here we study the wind-shearing radii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare it with gravitational shearing (drag force vs gravitational tidal forces) We then discuss the role of wind-shearing for the stability and survival of binary planetesimals
We are conducting a planet search survey with HARPS since seven years The volume-limited stellar sample includes all F2 to M0 main-sequence stars within 57 5 pc where extrasolar planetary signatures are systematically searched for with the radial-velocity technics In this paper we report the discovery of new substellar companions of seven main-sequence stars and one giant star
detected through multiple Doppler measurements with the instrument HARPS installed on the ESO 3 6m telescope La Silla Chile These extrasolar planets orbit the stars HD 1690 HD 25171 HD 33473A HD 89839 HD 113538 HD 167677 and HD 217686 The already-published giant planet around HD 72659 is also analysed here
and its elements are better determined by the addition of HARPS and Keck data The other discoveries are giant planets in distant orbits ranging from 0 3 to 29 MJup in mass and between 0 7 and 10 years in orbital period The low metallicity of most of these new planet-hosting stars reinforces the current trend for long-distance planets around metal-poor stars
<br>Long-term radial-velocity surveys allow probing the outskirts of extrasolar planetary systems although confidence in the solution may be low until more than one orbital period is fully covered by the observations For many systems discussed in this paper longer baselines are necessary to refine the radial-velocity fit and derive planetary parameters
Simulations of the moon-forming impact suggest that most of the lunar material derives from the impactor rather than the Earth Measurements of lunar samples however reveal an oxygen isotope composition that is indistinguishable from terrestrial samples and clearly distinct from meteorites coming from Mars and Vesta Here we explore the possibility that the silicate Earth and impactor were compositionally distinct with respect to oxygen isotopes
and that the terrestrial magma ocean and lunar-forming material underwent turbulent mixing and equilibration in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact This mixing may arise in the molten disk epoch between the impact and lunar accretion lasting perhaps 10^2-10^3 yr The implications of this idea for the geochemistry of the Moon
Despite the existence of many short-period hot Jupiters there is not one hot Neptune with an orbital period less than 2 5 days Here we discuss a cluster analysis of the currently known 106 transiting exoplanets to investigate a possible explanation for this observation We find two distinct clusters in the mass-density space
one with hot Jupiters with a wide range of orbital periods (0 8--114 days) and a narrow range of planet radii (1 2 +- 0 2 R_J); and another one with a mixture of super-Earths hot Neptunes and hot Jupiters exhibiting a surprisingly narrow period distribution (3 7 +- 0
These two clusters follow different distributions in the period-radius parameter plane The branch of sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets is censored by the orbital period at large-radii no planets with mass between 0 02--0 8 M_J or with radius between 0 25--1 0 R_J are known with P_orb&lt;2 5 days This clustering is not predicted by current theories of planet formation and evolution that we also review briefly
We investigate the evolution of grains composed of an ice shell surrounding an olivine core as they pass through a spiral shock in a protoplanetary disk We use published three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of massive self-gravitating protoplanetary disks to extract the thermodynamics of spiral shocks in the region between 10 and 20 AU from the central star
As the density wave passes it heats the grains causing them to lose their ice shell and resulting in a lowering of the grain opacity In addition since grains of different sizes will have slightly different temperatures there will be a migration of ice from the hotter grains to the cooler ones
The rate of migration depends on the temperature of the background gas so a grain distribution that is effectively stable for low temperatures can undergo an irreversible change in opacity if the gas is temporarily heated to above $\sim 150$\ K We find that the opacity can drop more and at a significantly faster rate throughout the spiral shocks relative to the prediction of standard dust grains models adopted in hydrodynamical calculations of protoplanetary disks
Kepler&#39;s orbits with corrections due to Special Relativity are explored using the Lagrangian formalism A very simple model includes only relativistic kinetic energy by defining a Lagrangian that is consistent with both the relativistic momentum of Special Relativity and Newtonian gravity The corresponding equations of motion are solved in a Keplerian limit
resulting in an approximate relativistic orbit equation that has the same form as that derived from General Relativity in the same limit and clearly describes three characteristics of relativistic Keplerian orbits precession of perihelion; reduced radius of circular orbit; and increased eccentricity The prediction for the rate of precession of perihelion is in agreement with established calculations using only Special Relativity
All three characteristics are qualitatively correct though suppressed when compared to more accurate general-relativistic calculations This model is improved upon by including relativistic gravitational potential energy The resulting approximate relativistic orbit equation has the same form and symmetry as that derived using the very simple model and more accurately describes characteristics of relativistic orbits
For example the prediction for the rate of precession of perihelion of Mercury is one-third that derived from General Relativity These Lagrangian formulations of the special-relativistic Kepler problem are equivalent to the familiar vector calculus formulations In this Keplerian limit these models are supposed to be physical based on the likeness of the equations of motion to those derived using General Relativity
The homogeneous spectroscopic determination of the stellar parameters is a mandatory step for transit detections from space Knowledge of which population the planet hosting stars belong to places constraints on the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems We used the FLAMES/GIRAFFE multi-fiber instrument at ESO to spectroscopically observe samples of stars in three CoRoT/Exoplanet fields
namely the LRa01 LRc01 and SRc01 fields and characterize their stellar populations We present accurate atmospheric parameters Teff logg [M/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]\ derived for 1227 stars in these fields using the \matisse algorithm The latter is based on the spectral synthesis methodology and automatically provides stellar parameters for large samples of observed spectra
We trained and applied this algorithm to \flames observations covering the Mg \textsc{i} b spectral range It was calibrated on reference stars and tested on spectroscopic samples from other studies in the literature The barycentric radial velocities and an estimate of the Vsini values were measured using cross-correlation techniques We corrected our samples in the LRc01 and LRa01 CoRoT fields for selection effects to characterize their FGK dwarf stars population
and compiled the first unbiased reference sample for the in-depth study of planet metallicity relationship in these CoRoT fields We conclude that the FGK dwarf population in these fields mainly exhibit solar metallicity We show that for transiting planet finding missions the probability of finding planets as a function of metallicity could explain the number of planets found in the LRa01 and LRc01 CoRoT fields
The wealth of information in the Gaia catalogue of exoplanets will constitute a fundamental contribution to several hot topics of the astrophysics of planetary systems I briefly review the potential impact of Gaia micro-arsec astrometry in several areas of exoplanet science discuss what key follow-up observations might be required as a complement to Gaia data
We present the current status of two new fully automated reduction and analysis pipelines built for the Euler telescope and the CORALIE spectrograph Both pipelines have been designed and built independently at the Universidad de Chile and Universidad Catolica by the two authors Each pipeline has also been written on two different platforms
IDL and Python and both can run fully automatically through full reduction and analysis of CORALIE datasets The reduction goes through all standard steps from bias subtraction flat-fielding scattered light removal optimal extraction and full wavelength calibration of the data using well exposed ThAr arc lamps The reduced data are then cross-correlated with a binary template matched to the spectral type of each star and the cross-correlation functions are fit with a Gaussian to extract precision radial-velocities
For error analysis we are currently testing bootstrap jackknifing and cross validation methods to properly determine uncertainties directly from the data Our pipelines currently show long term stability at the 12-15m/s level measured by observations of two known radial-velocity standard stars In the near future we plan to get the stability down to the 5-6m/s level and also transfer these pipelines to other instruments like HARPS
We present a re-analysis of archival HST/NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanet system HD 189733 from which detections of several molecules have been claimed As expected we can replicate the transmission spectrum previously published when we use an identical model for the systematic effects although the uncertainties are larger as we use a residual permutation algorithm in an effort to account for instrumental systematics
We also find that the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when slightly changing the instrument model and conclude that the NICMOS transmission spectrum is too dependent on the method used to remove systematics to be considered a robust detection of molecular species given that there is no physical reason to believe that the baseline flux should be modelled as a linear function of any chosen set of parameters
We present time-resolved photometric observations of Jupiter family comet 17P/Holmes during its dramatic outburst of 2007 The observations from the orbiting Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) provide the most complete measure of the whole-coma brightness free from the effects of instrumental saturation and with a time-resolution well-matched to the rapid brightening of the comet
The lightcurve is divided into two distinct parts A rapid rise between the first SMEI observation on UT 2007 October 24 06h 37m (mid-integration) and UT 2007 October 25 is followed by a slow decline until the last SMEI observation on UT 2008 April 6 22h 16m (mid-integration) We find that the rate of change of the brightness is reasonably well-described by a Gaussian function having a central time of UT 2007 October 24
The maximum rate of brightening occurs some 1 2 days after the onset of activity At the peak the scattering cross-section grows at 1070+/-40 km^2/s while the (model-dependent) mass loss rates inferred from the lightcurve reach a maximum at 3+/-10^5 kg/s The integrated mass in the coma lies in the range (2 to 90)x10^10 kg
corresponding to 0 2% to 10% of the nucleus mass while the kinetic energy of the ejecta is (0 6 to 30) MTonnes TNT The particulate coma mass could be contained within a shell on the nucleus of thickness ~1 5 to 60 m This is comparable to the distance traveled by conducted heat in the century since the previous outburst of 17P/Holmes
We study the chaotic orbital evolution of planetary systems focusing on secular (i e orbit-averaged) interactions because these often dominate on long timescales We first focus on the evolution of a test particle that is forced by multiple massive planets To linear order in eccentricity and inclination its orbit precesses with constant frequencies
But nonlinearities can shift the frequencies into and out of secular resonance with the planets&#39; eigenfrequencies or with linear combinations of those frequencies The overlap of these nonlinear secular resonances drive secular chaos in planetary systems We quantify the resulting dynamics for the first time by calculating the locations and widths of nonlinear secular resonances
When results from both analytical calculations and numerical integrations are displayed together in a newly developed &#34;map of the mean momenta&#34; (MMM) the agreement is excellent This map is particularly revealing for non-coplanar planetary systems and demonstrates graphically that chaos emerges from overlapping secular resonances We then apply this newfound understanding to Mercury
Previous numerical simulations have established that Mercury&#39;s orbit is chaotic and that Mercury might even collide with Venus or the Sun We show that Mercury&#39;s chaos is primarily caused by the overlap between resonances that are combinations of four modes the Jupiter-dominated eccentricity mode the Venus-dominated inclination mode and Mercury&#39;s free eccentricity and inclination
Numerical integration of the Solar system confirms that a slew of these resonant angles alternately librate and circulate We are able to calculate the threshold for Mercury to become chaotic Jupiter and Venus must have eccentricity and inclination of a few percent Mercury appears to be perched on the threshold for chaos
Fewer giants planets are found around M dwarfs than around more massive stars and this dependence of planetary characteristics on the mass of the central star is an important observational diagnostic of planetary formation theories In part to improve on those statistics we are monitoring the radial velocities of nearby M dwarfs with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3
We present here the detection of giant planets around two nearby M0 dwarfs planets with minimum masses of respectively 5 Jupiter masses and 1 Saturn mass orbit around Gl 676A and HIP 12961 The latter is by over a factor of two the most massive planet found by radial velocity monitoring of an M dwarf
but its being found around an early M-dwarf is in approximate line with the upper envelope of the planetary vs stellar mass diagram HIP 12961 ([Fe/H]=-0 07) is slightly more metal-rich than the average solar neighborhood ([Fe/H]=-0 17) and Gl 676A ([Fe/H=0 18) significantly so The two stars together therefore reinforce the growing trend for giant planets being more frequent around more metal-rich M dwarfs
We analyse some properties of circumplanetary discs Flow through such discs may provide most of the mass to gas giant planets and such discs are likely sites for the formation of regular satellites We model these discs as accretion discs subject to the tidal forces of the central star The tidal torques from the star remove the disc angular momentum near the disc outer edge and permit the accreting disc gas to lose angular momentum at the rate appropriate for steady accretion
Circumplanetary discs are truncated near the radius where periodic ballistic orbits cross where tidal forces on the disc are strong This radius occurs at approximately 0 4 r_H for the planet Hill radius r_H During the T Tauri stage of disc accretion the disc is fairly thick with aspect ratio H/r &gt; 0
For a circular or slightly eccentric orbit planet no significant resonances lie within the main body of the disc Tidally driven waves involving resonances nonetheless play an important role in truncating the disc especially when it is fairly thick We model the disc structure using one dimensional time-dependent and steady-state models and also two dimensional SPH simulations
The circumplanetary disc structure depends on the variation of the disc turbulent viscosity with radius and is insensitive to the angular distribution of the accreting gas Dead zones may occur within the circumplanetary disc and result in density structures If the disc is turbulent throughout the predicted disc structure near the location of the regular Jovian and Saturnian satellites is smooth with no obvious feature that would favor formation at their current locations
Using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph we have performed mid-infrared spectroscopy on the young binary brown dwarf 2MASS J04414489+2301513 (15 AU) in the Taurus star-forming region The spectrum exhibits excess continuum emission that likely arises from a circumstellar disk around the primary Silicate emission is not detected in these data indicating the presence of significant grain growth
This is one of the few brown dwarf disks at such a young age (~1 Myr) that has been found to lack silicate emission To quantitatively constrain the properties of the disk we have compared the spectral energy distribution of 2MASS J04414489+2301513 to the predictions of our vertical structure codes for irradiated accretion disks
Our models suggest that the remaining atmospheric grains of moderately depleted layers may have grown to a size of $\gtrsim5$ micron In addition our model fits indicate an outer radius of 0 2-0 3 AU for the disk The small size of this circumprimary disk could be due to truncation by the secondary
Recent observations have revealed two new classes of planetary orbits Rossiter- Mclaughlin (RM) measurements have revealed hot Jupiters in high-obliquity orbits In addition direct-imaging has discovered giant planets at large (~ 100 AU) separations via direct-imaging technique Simple-minded disk-migration scenarios are inconsistent with the high-inclination (and even retrograde) orbits as seen in recent RM measurements
Furthermore forming giant planets at large semi-major axis (a) may be challenging in the core-accretion paradigm We perform many N-body simulations to explore the two above-mentioned orbital architectures Planet-planet scattering in a multi-planet system can naturally excite orbital inclinations Planets can also get scattered to large distances Large-a planetary orbits created from planet-planet scattering are expected to have high eccentricities (e)
Theoretical models predict that the observed long-period planets such as Fomalhaut-b have moderate e \approx 0 3 Interestingly these are also in systems with disks We find that if a massive-enough outer disk is present a scattered planet may be circularized at large a via dynamical friction from the disk and repeated scattering of the disk particles
We report on measurements of extremely high reflection rates of solar wind particles from regolith-covered lunar surfaces Measurements by the Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon show that up to 20% of the impinging solar wind protons are reflected from the lunar surface back to space as neutral hydrogen atoms
The planetary ephemeris is an essential tool for interplanetary spacecraft navigation studies of solar system dynamics (including for example barycenter corrections for pulsar timing ephemeredes) the prediction of occultations and tests of general relativity We are carrying out a series of astrometric VLBI observations of the Cassini spacecraft currently in orbit around Saturn
using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) These observations provide positions for the center of mass of Saturn in the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) with accuracies ~0 3 milli-arcsecond (1 5 nrad) or about 2 km at the average distance of Saturn This paper reports results from eight observing epochs between 2006 October and 2009 April
These data are combined with two VLBA observations by other investigators in 2004 and a Cassini-based gravitational deflection measurement by Fomalont et al in 2009 to constrain a new ephemeris (DE 422) The DE 422 post-fit residuals for Saturn with respect to the VLBA data are generally 0 2 mas
but additional observations are needed to improve the positions of all of our phase reference sources to this level Over time we expect to be able to improve the accuracy of all three coordinates in the Saturn ephemeris (latitude longitude and range) by a factor of at least three This will represent a significant improvement not just in the Saturn ephemeris but also in the link between the inner and outer solar system ephemeredes and in the link to the inertial ICRF
A promising method for detecting earth-sized exoplanets is the timing analysis of a known transit The technique allows a search for variations in either the transit duration or the center induced by the perturbation of a third body e g a second planet or an exomoon By applying this method
the TASTE (The Asiago Search for Transit Timing variations of Exoplanets) project will collect high-precision short-cadence light curves for a selected sample of transits by using imaging differential photometry at the Asiago 1 82m telescope The first light curves show that our project can achieve a competitive timing accuracy as well as a significant improvement of the orbital parameters
We report the results of the first transit timing variation (TTV) analysis of the very hot Jupiter OGLE-TR-132b using ten transits collected over a seven-year period Our analysis combines three previously published transit light curves with seven new transits which were observed between February 2008 and May 2009 with the new MagIC-e2V instrument on the Magellan Telescopes in Chile
We provide a revised planetary radius of R_p = 1 23+/-0 07 R_J which is slightly larger than but consistent within the errors of the previously published results Analysis of the planet-to-star radius ratio orbital separation inclination and transit duration reveals no apparent variation in any of those parameters during the time span observed
We also find no sign of transit timing variations larger than -108+/-49 s with most residuals very close to zero This allows us to place an upper limit of 5-10 M_Earth for a coplanar low-eccentricity perturber in either the 2 1 or 3 2 mean-motion resonance with OGLE-TR-132b We similarly find that the data are entirely consistent with a constant orbital period and there is no evidence for orbital decay within the limits of precision of our data
Observations on comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) were made at phase angles close to opposition ($1 7^{\circ}$ - $10^{\circ}$) Photometric observations were carried out during 2009 February 24-28 in the IHW blue and red continuum and $R$ broad band using photo-polarimeter mounted on the 1 2m telescope at Mt Abu IR Observatory
In all the bands a significant linear increase in brightness with decreasing phase angle is detected for the above phase angle range The phase coefficient ($\beta = 0 040\pm 0 001$ mag deg$^{-1}$ estimated in IHW red (6840Å) filter band) is found to be independent of wavelength No non-linear opposition surge is observed for phase angle $&gt;1
The linear increase in brightness with decreasing phase angle in the range mentioned earlier can be explained using the shadow hiding model The colour of the comet is found to be similar to the solar colour indicating the dominance of grains larger than $0 1\mu m$ A dip in the brightness of about 0
We review the current theoretical understanding how growth from micro-meter sized dust to massive giant planets occurs in disks around young stars After introducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system from observed protoplanetary disks and from the extrasolar planets we simplify the problem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to occur in a sequential way
In the first stage - the growth from dust to kilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central importance We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode as well as a gravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust In the next stage planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size
Gravity is now the dominant force The mass accretion can be strongly non-linear leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining planetesimals In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU) some of these bodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous envelope
This is the stage of giant planet formation as understood within the core accretion-gas capture paradigm We also discuss the direct gravitational collapse model where giant planets are thought to form directly via a gravitational fragmentation of the gas disk In the inner system protoplanets collide in the last stage - probably after the dispersal of the gaseous disk - in giant impacts until the separations between the remaining terrestrial planets become large enough to allow long term stability
(Abridged) Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a turbulent solar nebula are used to study the growth of dust mantles swept up by chondrules A small neighborhood of the solar nebula is represented by an orbiting patch of gas at a radius of 3 AU and includes vertical stratification of the gas density
The differential rotation of the nebular gas is replaced by a shear flow Turbulence is driven by destabilization of the flow as a result of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) whereby magnetic field lines anchored to the gas are continuously stretched by the shearing motion A passive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well coupled to the gas
and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that interact with the gas through drag Whenever a chondrule enters a region permeated by dust its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust density and the relative velocity between itself and the dust The local dust abundance decreases accordingly
Different chondrule volume densities lead to varying depletion and rimmed-chondrule size growth times Most of the dust sweep-up occurs within 1 gas scale height of the nebula midplane Chondrules can reach their asymptotic radius in 10 to 800 years The vertical variation of nebula turbulent intensity results in a moderate dependence of mean rimmed-chondrule size with nebula height
Exoplanets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star However additional planetary formation and evolution routes may exist in old evolved binary systems Here we discuss the implications of binary stellar evolution on planetary systems In these binary systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars
where mass is lost from one star and could be transferred to its binary companion and may form an accretion disk around it This raises the possibility that such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a new second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations
Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically effected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly formed disk Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems and may show various observational signatures
Most notably second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible or less favorable for first generation planets The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second generation character
Despite its importance to questions of lunar origin the chemical composition of the Moon is not precisely known In recent years however the isotopic composition of lunar samples has been determined to high precision and found to be indistinguishable from the terrestrial mantle despite widespread isotopic heterogeneity in the Solar System
In the context of the giant-impact hypothesis this level of isotopic homogeneity can evolve if the proto-lunar disk and post-impact Earth undergo turbulent mixing into a single uniform reservoir while the system is extensively molten and partially vaporized In the absence of liquid-vapor separation such a model leads to the lunar inheritance of the chemical composition of the terrestrial magma ocean
Hence the turbulent mixing model raises the question of how chemical differences arose between the silicate Earth and Moon Here we explore the consequences of liquid-vapor separation in one of the settings relevant to the lunar composition the silicate vapor atmosphere of the post-giant-impact Earth We use a model atmosphere to quantify the extent to which rainout can generate chemical differences by enriching the upper atmosphere in the vapor
and show that plausible parameters can generate the postulated enhancement in the FeO/MgO ratio of the silicate Moon relative to the Earth&#39;s mantle Moreover we show that liquid-vapor separation also generates measurable mass-dependent isotopic offsets between the silicate Earth and Moon and that precise silicon isotope measurements can be used to constrain the degree of chemical fractionation during this earliest period of lunar history
Stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements have proven to be a very successful method for detecting extrasolar planets Analysing RV data to determine the parameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge owing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between orbital parameters Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed data is an even more difficult task
Bayesian model selection provides a mathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal posterior probabilities of models with different number of planets but the use of this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the computational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence Nonetheless Bayesian model selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing observational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets
We present a new and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar planets as well as for inferring their orbital parameters without having to calculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number of planets Instead we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a conservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional planet into the model
We apply this method to simulated data-sets containing one and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets and reliable constraints on the orbital parameters We also apply our method to RV measurements of HD 37124 47 Ursae Majoris and HD 10180 For HD 37124 we confirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system
We consider the planar three body problem of planetary type and we study the generation and continuation of periodic orbits and mainly of asymmetric periodic orbits Asymmetric orbits exist in the restricted circular three body problem only in particular resonances called &#34;asymmetric resonances&#34; However numerical studies showed that in the general three body problem asymmetric orbits may exist not only for asymmetric resonances
but for other kinds too In this work we show the existence of asymmetric periodic orbits in the elliptic restricted problem These orbits are continued and clarify the origin of many asymmetric periodic orbits in the general problem Also we illustrate how the families of periodic orbits of the restricted circular problem and those of the elliptic one join smoothly and form families in the general problem
Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are mainly protons confined in the galactic magnetic field to form an isotropic flux inside the galaxy Before reaching the Earth orbit they enter the Heliosphere and undergo diffusion convection magnetic drift and adiabatic energy loss The result is a reduction of particles flux at low energy (below 10 GeV)
called solar modulation We realized a quasi time-dependent 2D Stochastic Simulation of Solar Modulation that is able to reproduce CR spectra once known the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) We were able to estimate the different behaviors associated to the polarity dependence of the Heliospheric modulation for particles as well as for antiparticles
We present the first high-precision photometry of the transiting extrasolar planetary system WASP-7 obtained using telescope defocussing techniques and reaching a scatter of 0 68 mmag per point We find that the transit depth is greater and that the host star is more evolved than previously thought The planet has a significantly larger radius (1
The giant planets of our solar system possess envelopes consisting mainly of hydrogen and helium but are also significantly enriched in heavier elements relatively to our Sun In order to better constrain how these heavy elements have been delivered we quantify the amount accreted during the so-called &#34;late heavy bombardment&#34;
at a time when planets were fully formed and planetesimals could not sink deep into the planets On the basis of the &#34;Nice model&#34; we obtain accreted masses (in terrestrial units) equal to $0 15\pm0 04 \rm\ M_\oplus$ for Jupiter and $0 08 \pm 0 01 \rm\ M_\oplus$ for Saturn
For the two other giant planets the results are found to depend mostly on whether they switched position during the instability phase For Uranus the accreted mass is $0 051 \pm 0 003 \rm\ M_\oplus$ with an inversion and $0 030 \pm 0 001 \rm\ M_\oplus$ without an inversion Neptune accretes $0
M_\oplus$ in models in which it is initially closer to the Sun than Uranus and $0 066 \pm 0 006 \rm\ M_\oplus$ otherwise With well-mixed envelopes this corresponds to an increase in the enrichment over the solar value of $0 033 \pm 0 001$ and $0 074 \pm 0 007$ for Jupiter and Saturn
respectively For the two other planets we find the enrichments to be $2 1 \pm 1 4$ (w/ inversion) or $1 2 \pm 0 7$ (w/o inversion) for Uranus and $2 0 \pm 1 2$ (w/ inversion) or $2 7 \pm 1 6$ (w/o inversion) for Neptune This is clearly insufficient to explain the inferred enrichments of $\sim 4$ for Jupiter
Brown dwarfs are intermediate objects between planets and stars The lower end of the brown-dwarf mass range overlaps with the one of massive planets and therefore the distinction between planets and brown-dwarf companions may require to trace the individual formation process We present results on new potential brown-dwarf companions of Sun-like stars
which were discovered using CORALIE radial-velocity measurements By combining the spectroscopic orbits and Hipparcos astrometric measurements we have determined the orbit inclinations and therefore the companion masses for many of these systems This has revealed a mass range between 25 and 45 Jupiter masses almost void of objects suggesting a possible dividing line between massive planets and sub-stellar companions
Based on the quantum hydrodynamic model a new relationship between the electrostatic-potential and the electron-density in the ultra-dense plasma is derived Propagation of arbitrary amplitude nonlinear ion waves is then investigated in a completely degenerate dense dusty electron-ion plasma using this new energy relation for the relativistic electrons in the ground of quantum hydrodynamics model and the results are compared to the case of semiclassical Thomas-Fermi dusty plasma
Using the standard pseudo-potential approach it is remarked that the Fermi-Dirac plasma in contrast to the Thomas-Fermi counterpart accommodates a wide variety of nonlinear excitations such as positive-/negative-potential ion solitary and periodic waves double-layers and double-wells It is also remarked that the relativistic degeneracy parameter which relates to the mass-density of plasma has significant effects on the allowed matching-speed range in dusty Fermi-Dirac plasmas
Using ab initio simulations we investigate whether water ice is stable in the cores of giant planets or whether it dissolves into the layer of metallic hydrogen above By Gibbs free energy calculations we find that for pressures between 10 and 40 Mbar the ice-hydrogen interface is unstable at temperatures above approximately 3000 K
We use the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) to simulate lake storms on Mars finding that intense localized precipitation will occur for lake size &gt;=10^3 km^2 Mars has a low-density atmosphere so deep convection can be triggered by small amounts of latent heat release In our reference simulation the buoyant plume lifts vapor above condensation level
forming a 20km-high optically-thick cloud Ice grains grow to 200 microns radius and fall near (or in) the lake at mean rates up to 1 5 mm/hr water equivalent (maximum rates up to 6 mm/hr water equivalent) Because atmospheric temperatures outside the surface layer are always well below 273K supersaturation and condensation begin at low altitudes above lakes on Mars
In contrast to Earth lake-effect storms lake storms on Mars involve continuous precipitation and their vertical velocities and plume heights exceed those of tropical thunderstorms on Earth Convection does not reach above the planetary boundary layer for lakes &lt;&lt;10^3 km^2 or for atmospheric pressure &gt;O(10^2) mbar Instead vapor is advected downwind with little cloud formation
Precipitation occurs as snow and the daytime radiative forcing at the land surface due to plume vapor and storm clouds is too small to melt snow directly (&lt;+10 W/m^2) However if orbital conditions are favorable then the snow may be seasonally unstable to melting and produce runoff to form channels
We calculate the probability of melting by running thermal models over all possible orbital conditions and weighting their outcomes by probabilities given by Laskar et al 2004 We determine that for an equatorial vapor source sunlight 15% fainter than at present and snowpack with albedo 0 28 (0 35) melting may occur with 4%(0
The timing method using either stellar pulsations or eclipse timing of close binaries as a clock is proving to be an efficient way to detect planets around stars that have evolved beyond the red giant branch In this article we present a short review of the recent discoveries and we investigate the potential of the timing method using data both from ground-based facilities as well as from the Kepler and CoRoT space missions
We investigated the size distribution of high-inclination main-belt asteroids (MBAs) to explore asteroid collisional evolution under hypervelocity collisions of around 10 km/s We performed a wide-field survey for high-inclination sub-km MBAs using the 8 2-m Subaru Telescope with the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) Suprime-Cam archival data were also used
A total of 616 MBA candidates were detected in an area of 9 0 deg^2 with a limiting magnitude of 24 0 mag in the SDSS r filter Most of candidate diameters were estimated to be smaller than 1 km We found a scarcity of sub-km MBAs with high inclination
Cumulative size distributions (CSDs) were constructed using Subaru data and published asteroid catalogs The power-law indexes of the CSDs were 2 17 +/- 0 02 for low-inclination (&lt; 15 deg) MBAs and 2 02 +/- 0 03 for high-inclination (&gt; 15 deg) MBAs in the 0 7-50 km diameter range
The high-inclination MBAs had a shallower CSD We also found that the CSD of S-like MBAs had a small slope with high inclination whereas the slope did not vary with inclination in the C-like group The most probable cause of the shallow CSD of the high-inclination S-like MBAs is the large power-law index in the diameter-impact strength curve in hypervelocity collisions

Durda et al (2004) using numerical models suggested that binary asteroids with large separation called Escaping Ejecta Binaries (EEBs) can be created by fragments ejected from a disruptive impact event It is thought that six binary asteroids recently discovered might be EEBs because of the high separation between their components (~100 &gt; a/Rp &gt; ~20)
However the rotation periods of four out of the six objects measured by our group and others and presented here show that these suspected EEBs have fast rotation rates of 2 5 to 4 hours Because of the small size of the components of these binary asteroids linked with this fast spinning
we conclude that the rotational-fission mechanism which is a result of the thermal YORP effect is the most likely formation scenario Moreover scaling the YORP effect for these objects shows that its timescale is shorter than the estimated ages of the three relevant Hirayama families hosting these binary asteroids Therefore
only the largest (D~19 km) suspected asteroid (317) Roxane could be in fact the only known EEB In addition our results confirm the triple nature of (3749) Balam by measuring mutual events on its lightcurve that match the orbital period of a nearby satellite in addition to its distant companion
The MPF mission will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses greater than 0 1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0 5AU to infinity This includes analogs to all the Solar System&#39;s planets except for Mercury as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories
Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes Close-in planets with separations &lt; 0 5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey but these can be found by Kepler Other methods including ground-based microlensing cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide
The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing Thus a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of planetary systems
We describe an updated version of our hybrid N-body-coagulation code for planet formation In addition to the features of our 2006-2008 code our treatment now includes algorithms for the 1D evolution of the viscous disk the accretion of small particles in planetary atmospheres gas accretion onto massive cores and the response of N-bodies to the gravitational potential of the gaseous disk and the swarm of planetesimals
To validate the N-body portion of the algorithm we use a battery of tests in planetary dynamics As a first application of the complete code we consider the evolution of Pluto-mass planetesimals in a swarm of 0 1-1 cm pebbles In a typical evolution time of 1-3 Myr our calculations transform 0
The increasing number of extra-solar planets opens a new opportunity for studies of the formation of planetary systems Resonant systems are of particular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints on the unobservable formation and migration phase In this thesis formation scenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented
N-body simulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of proto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture into resonance The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger surface density than previously thought Proto-planets are exposed to stochastic forces generated by density fluctuations in the disc
A generic model of both a single planet and two planets in resonance being stochastically forced is presented The system GJ876 for example is stable for reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces but systems with lighter planets can get disrupted Even if they are not disrupted completely stochastic forces create characteristic
observable libration patterns Turbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet formation process Due to the large separation of scales the gravitational collapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically A scaled method is presented that allows for the correct treatment of self-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the relevant small scale processes
Interestingly this system is dynamically very similar to Saturn&#39;s rings The stochastic migration of small bodies in Saturn&#39;s rings is also studied Analytic predictions of the interactions of a moonlet/propeller with ring particles are compared to collisional N-body simulations with up to a million particles The random walk is fast enough to be directly observable by the Cassini spacecraft
With an emphasis in detecting Earth-like planets set forth by the 2010 Decadal Survey and in searching for planets around M dwarfs set forth by the 2008 Exoplanet Task Force radial velocity surveys with infrared echelle spectrometers will have a significant impact on future exoplanet studies Here we present the results of an infrared radial velocity survey of a sample of 14 late-M dwarfs with the NIRSPEC echelle spectrometer on the Keck II telescope
Using telluric lines for wavelength calibration we are able to achieve measurement precisions of 150-300 m/s over a year-long timeframe While we require more RV epochs to determine whether most of our stars have planetary-mass companions we have placed upper limits of 5-10 MJ on the masses of planets around a sub-set of our sample
New infrared absorption measurements of oxygen isotope ratios in CO gas from individual young stellar objects confirm that the solar system is anomalously high in its 18O/17O ratio compared with extra-solar oxygen in the Galaxy We show that this difference in oxygen isotope ratios is best explained by 1 per cent enrichment of the proto-solar molecular cloud by ejecta from type II supernovae from a cluster having of order a few hundred stars that predated the Sun by at least 10 to 20 Myr
In order to accurately model giant planets a whole set of observational constraints is needed As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets like mass radius and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable models a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain planetary models Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2
In this paper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about the interior structure of a planet With theoretical planetary models we investigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density distribution of a planet In particular we demonstrate the effect of the degeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a three-layer planetary model
The effect of a possible outer density discontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2 Hence there is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of a planet We show that the degeneracy of k2 with respect to a layer boundary in the envelope also occurs in existing planets
e g Saturn and the Hot Neptune GJ436b As a result of the degeneracy the planetary parameter k2 cannot be used to further constrain Saturnian models and for GJ436b only a maximum possible core mass can be derived from a given k2 To significantly narrow the uncertainty about the core mass of GJ436b the combined knowledge of k2 and atmospheric metallicity and temperature profile is necessary
We report first multicolor polarimetric measurements (UBV bands) for the hot Jupiters HD189733b and confirm our previously reported detection of polarization in the B band (Berdyugina et al 2008) The wavelength dependence of polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in the blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower signal in the V band
The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence detected also in the transmitted light during transits implies a rapid decrease of the polarization signal toward longer wavelengths Therefore the nondetection by Wiktorowicz (2009) based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband covering the V band and partly B and R bands is inconclusive and consistent with our detection in B
We discuss possible sources of the polarization and demonstrate that effects of incomplete cancellation of stellar limb polarization due to starspots or tidal perturbations are negligible as compared to scattering polarization in the planetary atmosphere We compare the observations with a Rayleigh-Lambert model and determine effective radii and geometrical albedos for different wavelengths
We provide a generalized discussion of tidal evolution to arbitrary order in the expansion of the gravitational potential between two spherical bodies of any mass ratio To accurately reproduce the tidal evolution of a system at separations less than five times the radius of the larger primary component the tidal potential due to the presence of a smaller secondary component is expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials to arbitrary order rather than truncated at leading order as is typically done in studies of well-separated system like the Earth and Moon
The equations of tidal evolution including tidal torques the changes in spin rates of the components and the change in semimajor axis (orbital separation) are then derived for binary asteroid systems with circular and equatorial mutual orbits Accounting for higher-order terms in the tidal potential serves to speed up the tidal evolution of the system leading to underestimates in the time rates of change of the spin rates
semimajor axis and mean motion in the mutual orbit if such corrections are ignored Special attention is given to the effect of close orbits on the calculation of material properties of the components in terms of the rigidity and tidal dissipation function based on the tidal evolution of the system
It is found that accurate determinations of the physical parameters of the system e g densities sizes and current separation are typically more important than accounting for higher-order terms in the potential when calculating material properties In the scope of the long-term tidal evolution of the semimajor axis and the component spin rates
Our knowledge about the physical processes determining the activity of comets were mainly influenced by several extremely successful space missions the predictions of theoretical models and the results of laboratory experiments However novel computer models should not be treated in isolation but should be based on experimental results Therefore a new experimental setup was constructed to investigate the temperature dependent sublimation properties of hexagonal water ice and the gas diffusion through a dry dust layer covering the ice surface
We show that this experimental setup is capable to reproduce known gas production rates of pure hexagonal water ice The reduction of the gas production rate due to an additional dust layer on top of the ice surface was measured and compared to the results of another experimental setup in which the gas diffusion through dust layers at room temperature was investigated
We found that the relative permeability of the dust layer is inversely proportional to its thickness which is also predicted by theoretical models However the measured absolute weakening of the gas flow was smaller than predicted by models This lack of correspondence between model and experiment may be caused by an ill-determination of the boundary condition in the theoretical models
which further demonstrates the necessity of laboratory investigations Furthermore the impedance of the dust layer to the ice evaporation was found to be similar to the impedance at room temperature which means that the temperature profile of the dust layer is not influencing the reduction of the gas production Finally
In this paper the CoRoT Exoplanet Science Team announces its 14th discovery Herein we discuss the observations and analyses that allowed us to derive the parameters of this system a hot Jupiter with a mass of $7 6 \pm 0 6$ Jupiter masses orbiting a solar-type star (F9V) with a period of only 1
We present a non-invasive technique for measuring the thermal conductivity of fragile and sensitive materials In the context of planet formation research the investigation of the thermal conductivity of porous dust aggregates provide important knowledge about the influence of heating processes like internal heating by radioactive decay of short-lived nuclei
e g 26Al on the evolution and growth of planetesimals The determination of the thermal conductivity was performed by a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations An IR camera measured the temperature distribution of the sample surface heated by a well-characterized laser beam The thermal conductivity as free parameter in the model calculations
exactly emulating the experiment was varied until the experimental and numerical temperature distributions showed best agreement Thus we determined for three types of porous dust samples consisting of spherical micrometer-sized SiO2 particles with volume filling factors in the range of 15% to 54% the thermal conductivity to be 0 002 to 0
We observed the near-Earth asteroid 2008 EV5 with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars and the Very Long Baseline Array during December 2008 EV5 rotates retrograde and its overall shape is a 400 /pm 50 m oblate spheroid The most prominent surface feature is a ridge parallel to the asteroid&#39;s equator that is broken by a concavity 150 m in diameter
Otherwise the asteroid&#39;s surface is notably smooth on decameter scales EV5&#39;s radar and optical albedos are consistent with either rocky or stony-iron composition The equatorial ridge is similar to structure seen on the rubble-pile near-Earth asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4 and is consistent with YORP spin-up reconfiguring the asteroid in the past
We model the heating of a primordial planetesimal by decay of the short-lived radionuclides Al-26 and Fe-60 to determine (i) the timescale on which melting will occur; (ii) the minimum size of a body that will produce silicate melt and differentiate; (iii) the migration rate of molten material within the interior; and (iv) the thermal consequences of the transport of Al-26 in partial melt
Our models incorporate results from previous studies of planetary differentiation and are constrained by petrologic (i e grain size distributions) isotopic (e g Pb-Pb and Hf-W ages) and mineralogical properties of differentiated achondrites We show that formation of a basaltic crust via melt percolation was limited by the formation time of the body
matrix grain size and viscosity of the melt We show that low viscosity (&lt; 1 Pa-s) silicate melt can buoyantly migrate on a timescale comparable to the mean life of Al-26 The equilibrium partitioning of Al into silicate partial melt and the migration of that melt acts to dampen internal temperatures
However subsequent heating from the decay of Fe-60 generated melt fractions in excess of 50% thus completing differentiation for bodies that accreted within 2 Myr of CAI formation (i e the onset of isotopic decay) Migration and concentration of Al-26 into a crust results in remelting of that crust for accretion times less than 2 Myr and for bodies &gt;100 km in size
We quantify the systematic impact of the non-spherical shape of transiting planets and brown dwarfs due to tidal forces and rotation on the observed transit depth Such a departure from sphericity leads to a bias in the derivation of the transit radius from the light curve and affects the comparison with planet structure and evolution models which assume spherical symmetry
As the tidally deformed planet projects its smallest cross section area during the transit the measured effective radius is smaller than the one of the unperturbed spherical planet This effect can be corrected by calculating the theoretical shape of the observed planet <br>We derive simple analytical expressions for the ellipsoidal shape of a fluid object (star or planet) accounting for both tidal and rotational deformations and calibratre it with fully numerical evolution models in the 0
Our calculations yield a 20% effect on the transit depth i e a 10% decrease of the measured radius for the extreme case of a 1Mjup planet orbiting a Sun-like star at 0 01AU For the closest planets detected so far (&lt; 0 05 AU) the effect on the radius is of the order of 1 to 10%
by no means a negligible effect enhancing the puzzling problem of the anomalously large bloated planets These corrections must thus be taken into account for a correct determination of the radius from the transit light curve <br>Our analytical expressions can be easily used to calculate these corrections due to the non-spherical shape of the planet
on the observed transit depth and thus to derive the planet&#39;s real equilibrium radius They can also be used to model ellipsoidal variations of the stellar flux now detected in the CoRoT and Kepler light curves We also derive directly usable analytical expressions for the moment of inertia oblateness and Love number (k_2) of a fluid planet as a function of its mass
The migration of the giant planets due to the scattering of planetesimals causes powerful resonances to move through the asteroid belt and the terrestrial planet region Exactly when and how the giant planets migrated is not well known In this paper we present results of an investigation of the formation of the terrestrial planets during and after the migration of the giant planets
The latter is assumed to have occurred immediately after the dissipation of the nebular disk -- i e &#34;early&#34; with respect to the timing of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) The presumed cause of our modeled early migration of the giant planets is angular mometum transfer between the planets and scattered planetesimals
We present an updated cumulative size distribution (CSD) for Jupiter Family comet (JFC) nuclei including a rigourous assessment of the uncertainty on the slope of the CSD The CSD is expressed as a power law N(&gt;r_N) \propto r_N^{-q} where r_N is the radius of the nuclei and q is the slope
We include a large number of optical observations published by ourselves and others since the comprehensive review in the &#34;Comets II&#34; book (Lamy et al 2004) and make use of an improved fitting method We assess the uncertainty on the CSD due to all of the unknowns and uncertainties involved (photometric uncertainty
assumed phase function albedo and shape of the nucleus) by means of Monte Carlo simulations In order to do this we also briefly review the current measurements of these parameters for JFCs Our final CSD has a slope q=1 92\pm 0 20 for nuclei with radius r_N \ge 1 25 km
It has been suggested in Hoyng (2009) that dynamo action can be analysed by expansion of the magnetic field into dynamo modes and statistical evaluation of the mode coefficients We here validate this method by analysing a numerical geodynamo model and comparing the numerically derived mean mode coefficients with the theoretical predictions
The model belongs to the class of kinematically stable dynamos with a dominating axisymmetric antisymmetric with respect to the equator and non-periodic fundamental dynamo mode The analysis requires a number of steps the computation of the so-called dynamo coefficients the derivation of the temporally and azimuthally averaged dynamo eigenmodes and the decomposition of the magnetic field of the numerical geodynamo model into the eigenmodes
For the determination of the theoretical mode excitation levels the turbulent velocity field needs to be projected on the dynamo eigenmodes We compare the theoretically and numerically derived mean mode coefficients and find reasonably good agreement for most of the modes Some deviation might be attributable to the approximation involved in the theory
Stellar insolation has been used as the main constraint on a planet&#39;s habitability However as more Earth-like planets are discovered around low-mass stars (LMSs) a re-examination of the role of tides on the habitability of exoplanets has begun Those studies have yet to consider the misalignment between a planet&#39;s rotational axis and the orbital plane normal
i e the planetary obliquity We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones around LMSs The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like obliquity of 23 5 deg to 5 deg the &#39;tilt erosion time&#39; is compared to the traditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis
eccentricity and stellar mass We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium rotation caused by obliquity tides The Super-Earth Gl581d and the planet candidate Gl581g are studied as examples for tidal processes Earth-like obliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around &lt;0 25 solar mass (M_sun) stars are eroded in &lt;0
Only terrestrial planets orbiting stars with masses &gt;0 9 M_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout the IHZ Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses &lt;0 25 M_sun undergo significant tidal heating due to obliquity tides The predictions of the two tidal models diverge significantly for e&gt;0
In our two-body simulations Gl581d&#39;s obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached its equilibrium state of half its orbital period in &lt;0 1 Gyr Tidal surface heating on the putative Gl581g is &lt;150 mW/m^2 as long as its eccentricity is &lt;0 3 Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone
We present a framework to conservatively estimate the probability that any particular planet-like transit signal observed by the Kepler mission is in fact a planet prior to any ground-based follow-up efforts We use Monte Carlo methods based on stellar population synthesis and Galactic structure models and report a priori false positive probabilities for every Kepler Object of Interest in tabular form
assuming a 20% intrinsic occurrence rate of close-in planets in the radius range 0 5 Rearth &lt; Rp &lt; 20 Rearth Almost every candidate has FPP &lt;10% and over half have FPP &lt;5% This probability varies most strongly with the magnitude and Galactic latitude of the Kepler target star and more weakly with transit depth
We establish that a single deep high-resolution image will be an extremely effective follow-up tool for the shallowest (Earth-sized) transits providing the quickest route towards probabilistically &#34;validating&#34; the smallest candidates by potentially decreasing the false positive probability of an earth-sized transit around a faint star from &gt;10% to &lt;1% On the other hand
we show that the most useful follow-up observations for moderate-depth (super-Earth and Neptune-sized) candidates are shallower AO imaging and high S/N spectroscopy Since Kepler has detected many more planetary signals than can be positively confirmed with ground-based follow-up efforts in the near term these calculations will be crucial to using the ensemble of Kepler data to determine population characteristics of planetary systems
The results of studies of 2006 VV2 and 13170 (1999 HF1) binary asteroids of NEA group (45) Eugenia and (87) Sylvia triple asteroids (762) Pulcova and (90) Antiope binary asteroids of the Main Belt are presented For the asteroid 2006 VV2 color indices (B-V V-R R-I) the absolute magnitude (16
a taxonomy class the density (2 71 \pm 0 04 g/cm3) the masses of components as well as refined form of the main component and the satellite orbit were determined For the (45) Eugenia asteroid refined form the main component simulated orbits of both satellites were determined and it was showed that the axis of rotation of the main component undergoes a forced precession with an angle of 10 deg and a period of 66 days
Based on a comparison of model lightcurves with observations over a long interval of time of (90) Antiope asteroid reflective surface properties of its components were investigated For asteroid (762) Pulcova form of the main component was determined and the reflective properties of its surface were investigated For asteroid 137170 (1999 HF1)
estimates of the size of the main component (a = 2 12 \pm 0 02 b = 1 77 \pm 0 01 c = 1 73 \pm 0 03 km) were made and possible stable orbit of the satellite (with the elements of a~6 2 km e~0 1 i~2 deg) was identified and of component masses were estimated
We present 13 years of pulsation timing measurements of the DBV white dwarf EC 2005-5234 Each of the four O-C diagrams mimic the sinusoidal behavior typically attributed to a planet + WD system However the amplitude and phase of the O-C variations are inconsistent with each other We discuss the impact of this result on timing based WD planet searches
About one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in the first four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems There are 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets 45 with three 8 with four and one each with five and six We characterize the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems
The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances Nonetheless there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance particularly near the 2
We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius relationship Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems Using the observed multiplicity frequencies we find that a single population of planetary systems that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of singly-transiting systems
On 1 February 2011 the Kepler Mission released data for 156 453 stars observed from the beginning of the science observations on 2 May through 16 September 2009 There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit like signatures detected in this period These are associated with 997 host stars Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius &lt; 1
and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 Earth radii &lt; radius &lt; 22 Earth radii) In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter Five are less than twice the size of the Earth
Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to area of the candidate Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates
after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases are 6% for Earth-size candidates 7% for super-Earth size candidates 17% for Neptune-size candidates and 4% for Jupiter-size candidates Multi-candidate transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems and 33 9% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems
We report on the results from the radial-velocity follow-up program performed to establish the planetary nature and to characterize the transiting candidates discovered by the space mission CoRoT We use the SOPHIE at OHP HARPS at ESO and the HIRES at Keck spectrographs to collect spectra and high- precision radial velocity (RV) measurements for several dozens dif- ferent candidates from CoRoT
We have measured the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect of several confirmed planets especially CoRoT- 1b which revealed that it is another highly inclined system Such high-precision RV data are necessary for the discovery of new tran- siting planets Furthermore several low mass planet candidates have emerged from our Keck and HARPS data
We present deep spectroscopic observations of the classical T Tauri stars DF Tau and V4046 Sgr in order to better characterize two important sources of far-ultraviolet continuum emission in protoplanetary disks These new Hubble Space Telescope-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations reveal a combination of line and continuum emission from collisionally excited H2 and emission from accretion shocks
H2 is the dominant emission in the 1400-1650 A band spectrum of V4046 Sgr while an accretion continuum contributes strongly across the far-ultraviolet spectrum of DF Tau We compare the spectrum of V4046 Sgr to models of electron-impact induced H2 emission to constrain the physical properties of the emitting region
after making corrections for attenuation within the disk We find reasonable agreement with the broad spectral characteristics of the H2 model implying N(H2) ~ 10^{18} cm^{-2} T(H2) = 3000^{+1000}_{-500} K and a characteristic electron energy in the range of ~ 50 - 100 eV We propose that self-absorption and hydrocarbons provide the dominant attenuation for H2 line photons originating within the disk
For both DF Tau and V4046 Sgr we find that a linear fit to the far-UV data can reproduce near-UV/optical accretion spectra We discuss outstanding issues concerning how these processes operate in protostellar/protoplanetary disks including the effective temperature and absolute strength of the radiation field in low-mass protoplanetary environments We find that the 912-2000A continuum in low-mass systems has an effective temperature of ~10^{4} K with fluxes 10^{5-7} times the interstellar level at 1 AU
A complete reassessment of the HST observations of the transits of the extrasolar planet HD209458b has provided a transmission spectrum of the atmosphere over a wide range of wavelengths Analysis of the NaI absorption line profile has already shown that the sodium abundance has to drop by at least a factor of ten above a critical altitude
Here we analyze the profile in the deep core of the NaI doublet line from HST and high-resolution ground-based spectra to further constrain the vertical structure of the HD209458b atmosphere With a wavelength-dependent cross section that spans more than 5 orders of magnitude we use the absorption signature of the NaI doublet as an atmospheric probe
The NaI transmission features are shown to sample the atmosphere of HD209458b over an altitude range of more than 6500km corresponding to a pressure range of 14 scale heights spanning 1 millibar to 1e-9 bar pressures By comparing the observations with a multi-layer model in which temperature is a free parameter at the resolution of the atmospheric scale height
we constrain the temperature vertical profile and variations in the Na abundance in the upper part of the atmosphere of HD209458b We find a rise in temperature above the drop in sodium abundance at the 3mbar level We also identify an isothermal atmospheric layer at 1500+/-100K spanning almost 6 scale heights in altitude
from 1e-5 to 1e-7 bar Above this layer the temperature rises again to 2500(+1500/-1000)K at 1e-9 bar indicating the presence of a thermosphere The resulting temperature-pressure (T-P) profile agrees with the Na condensation scenario at the 3 mbar level with a possible signature of sodium ionization at higher altitudes near the 3e-5 bar level
We report the discovery of a hot Jupiter transiting a subgiant star with an orbital period of 6 87 days thanks to public photometric data from the Kepler space mission and new radial velocity observations obtained by the SOPHIE spectrograph The planet KOI-428b with a radius of 1 17 +/- 0
Spitzer observations reveal the presence of warm debris from a tidally destroyed rocky and possibly icy planetary body orbiting the white dwarf GD 61 Ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of the metal-contaminated stellar photosphere reveal traces of hydrogen oxygen magnesium silicon iron and calcium The nominal ratios of these elements indicate an excess of oxygen relative to that expected from rock-forming metal oxides
Comets are believed to be born in the outer Solar System where the temperature is assumed to have never exceeded T ~ 100 K Surprisingly observations and samples of cometary dust particles returned to Earth showed that they are in fact made of a mix of ices as expected but also of materials forged at high-temperatures (T ~ 1500 K)
We propose a radically new view regarding the origin of the high-temperature processed materials in comets based on the recent &#34;Tidal Downsizing&#34; (TD) hypothesis for planet formation In the latter the outer proto-planetary disc is gravitationally unstable and forms massive giant planet embryos (GEs) These hot (T ~ hundreds to 2000 K) and dense regions
immersed in the background cold and low density disc are eventually disrupted We propose that both planets and the high-T materials in comets are synthesised inside the GEs Disruption of GEs separates planets and small solids as the latter are &#34;frozen-in&#34; into gas and are peeled off together with it
If it is commonly agreed that the presence of a (moderately) close stellar companion affects the formation and the dynamical evolution of giant planets the frequency of giant planets residing in binary systems separated by less than 100 AU is unknown To address this issue we have conducted with VLT/NACO a systematic adaptive optics search for moderately close stellar companions to 130 nearby solar-type stars
According to the data from Doppler surveys half of our targets host at least one planetary companion while the other half show no evidence for short-period giant planets We present here the final results of our survey which include a new series of second-epoch measurements to test for common proper motion
The new observations confirm the physical association of two companion candidates and prove the unbound status of many others These results strengthen our former conclusion that circumstellar giant planets are slightly less frequent in binaries with mean semimajor axes between 35 and 100 AU than in wider systems or around single stars
G and K giants are a class of radial velocity (RV) variables One reason for this variability are planetary companions which are indicated in time series of stellar spectra Since 2004 these spectra in the visual range were obtained with the high resolution coudé échelle spectrograph mounted on the 2m telescope of the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg (TLS) for a northern sample of 62 very bright K giants
In the South around 300 G and K giants were observed with HARPS mounted on the 3 6m telescope on La Silla The TLS sample contains at least 11 stars (18 %) which show low-amplitude long-period RV variations most likely due to planets This percentage of planet frequency is confirmed by preliminary results of the HARPS study
NASA&#39;s Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal the discovery of its first rocky planet Kepler-10b Two distinct sets of transit events were detected 1) a 152 +/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1
Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis Photometry was collected at 1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies
Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11 9 +/- 4 5 Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like Main Sequence star with Teff=5627 +/- 44 K Mstar=0 895 +/- 0 060 Msun and Rstar=1 056 +/- 0 021 Rsun Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition
When an extrasolar planet passes in front of its star (transits) its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the time between transits Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal more period ratios determine stability and dynamics mutual gravitational interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes
and the fraction of transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of planetary systems But few stars have more than one known transiting planet and none has more than three Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star that reveal six transiting planets five with orbital periods between 10 and 47 days plus a sixth one with a longer period
We present results from a radial-velocity survey of 373 giant stars at Lick Observatory which started in 1999 The previously announced planets iota Dra b and Pollux b are confirmed by continued monitoring The frequency of detected planetary companions appears to increase with metallicity The star nu Oph is orbited by two brown dwarf companions with masses of 22
Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest solar system solids known in primitive meteorites (chondrites) They predate the other components by 1-2 Myr and likely condensed within a short time interval close to the Sun in the gaseous protoplanetary disk Their preservation must counterbalance both the sunward drift caused by gas drag and the general inward motion of the entraining gas
We propose that an efficient outward transport of CAIs can be achieved by advection as a result of the viscous expansion of the disk provided it is initially less than 10 AU in size which we argue is plausible from both observational and theoretical points of view Gas drag would stop this outward motion within $10^5$ yr
However by that time a magnetically dead zone would have developed as gravitational instabilities fade away which would trap CAIs for a significant fraction of the disk lifetime because of the reduced advection velocities The dead zone would also prevent outward diffusion of subsequently condensed CAIs contributing to their observed narrow age range
The Gamma Cephei planetary system is one of the most interesting systems due to several reasons 1 ) it is the first planet candidate detected by precise radial velocity (RV) measurements that was discussed in the literature (Campbell et al 1988); 2 ) it is a tight binary system with a ~ 20AU; and 3
) the planet host star is an evolved K-type star In Hatzes et al (2003) we confirmed the presence of the planetary companion with a minimum mass of 1 7 M_Jup at 2 AU In this paper we present additional eight years of precise RV data from the Harlan J
Smith 2 7 m Telescope and its Tull Coude spectrograph at McDonald Observatory The 900 d signal that is interpreted as the presence of the giant planetary companion is strongly confirmed by adding the new data We present an updated orbital solution for the planet which shows that the planet is slightly more massive and the orbit more circular than previous results have suggested
In close eclipsing binaries measurements of the variations in binary&#39;s eclipse timing may be used to infer information about the existence of circumbinary objects To determine the possibility of the detection of such variations with CoRoT and Kepler space telescopes we have carried out an extensive study of the dynamics of a binary star system with a circumbinary planet
and calculated its eclipse timing variations (ETV) for different values of the mass-ratio and orbital elements of the binary and the perturbing body Here we present the results of our study and assess the detectability of the planet by comparing the resulting values of ETVs with the temporal sensitivity of CoRoT and Kepler
Several astrophysically relevant solid oxides and silicates have extremely small opacities in the visual and near-infrared in their pure forms Datasets for the opacities and for the imaginary part k of their complex indices of refraction are hardly available in these wavelength ranges We aimed at determining k for spinel
rutile anatase and olivine especially in the near-infrared region Our measurements were made with impurity-containing natural and synthetic stardust analogs Two experimental methods were used preparing small sections of natural minerals and synthesizing melt droplets under the electric arc furnace In both cases the aborption properties of the samples were measured by transmission spectroscopy
For spinel (MgAl2O4) anatase rutile (both TiO2) and olivine ((Mg Fe)2SiO4) the optical constants have been extended to the visual and near-infrared We highlight that the individual values of k and the absorption cross section depend strongly on the content in transition metals like iron Based on our measurements we infer that k values below 10^(-5) are very rare in natural minerals including stardust grains
if they occur at all Data for k and the absorption cross section are important for various physical properties of stardust grains such as temperature and radiation pressure With increasing absorption cross section due to impurities the equilibrium temperature of small grains in circumstellar shells increases as well We discuss why and to what extent this is the case
We extend the models presented in Mordasini et al (2009) to the formation of planets orbiting stars of different masses We discuss the properties of the resulting synthetic planet population in terms of mass orbit and metallicity distributions The population synthesis calculations we use are based on the planet formation model developed in Alibert et al
(2005a) which self-consistently takes into account planetary growth and migration in an evolving proto-planetary disk Using this model we generate synthetic populations of planets by following their growth in a large number of proto-planetary disks whose properties (mass and lifetime) are selected in a Monte Carlo fashion using probability distributions derived from observations
We show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of the central star has a direct and large influence on the properties of the resulting planet population In particular the observed paucity of large mass planets orbiting 0 5 Msun stars can directly be explained as resulting from a only slightly steeper than linear scaling
The observed lack of short period planet orbiting 2 0 Msun stars can also be attributed to this scaling but only if associated with a decrease of the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive than 1 5 Msun Finally we show that the distribution of minimum mass and semi-major axis of our synthetic planets are statistically comparable with observations
We compute grids of radiative-convective model atmospheres for Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune over a range of intrinsic fluxes and surface gravities The atmosphere grids serve as an upper boundary condition for models of the thermal evolution of the planets Unlike previous work we customize these grids for the specific properties of each planet
including the appropriate chemical abundances and incident fluxes as a function of solar system age Using these grids we compute new models of the thermal evolution of the major planets in an attempt to match their measured luminosities at their known ages Compared to previous work we find longer cooling times
predominantly due to higher atmospheric opacity at young ages For all planets we employ simple &#34;standard&#34; cooling models that feature adiabatic temperature gradients in the interior H/He and water layers and an initially hot starting point for the calculation of subsequent cooling For Jupiter we find a model cooling age 10% longer than previous work
a modest quantitative difference This may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates the temperatures in the deep interior of the planet For Saturn we find a model cooling age 20% longer than previous work However an additional energy source such as that due to helium phase separation
is still clearly needed For Neptune unlike in work from the 1980s and 1990s we match the measured Teff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet&#39;s current gravity field This is predominantly due to advances in the equation of state of water This may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection in its deep interior
The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints on models of planet formation including orbital migration and excitation of orbital eccentricities and inclinations NASA&#39;s Kepler mission has identified 1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011) The method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary systems (Holman et al
We perform a transit timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates We find that at least ~12% of planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive of TTVs representing at least ~65 TTV candidates In all cases the time span of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet masses and/or orbits
as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits) We find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per star suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets
We anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs Thus TTVs will provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital dynamics of low-mass planets If Kepler observations were extended to at least six years then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type stars
The detection of small mass planets with the radial-velocity technique is now confronted with the interference of stellar noise HARPS can now reach a precision below the meter-per-second which corresponds to the amplitudes of different stellar perturbations such as oscillation granulation and activity Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise of a few meter-per-second
The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity and calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies Based on Sun observations we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the surface of a rotating star We then calculate the radial-velocity effect induced by these spot groups as a function of time
Taking into account oscillation granulation activity and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to efficiently reduce all sources of noise Applying three measurements per night of 10 minutes every three days 10 nights a month seems the best tested strategy
Depending on the level of activity considered from log(R&#39;_HK)= -5 to -4 75 this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2 5 to 3 5 Earth masses in the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf Using Bern&#39;s model of planetary formation we estimate that for the same range of activity level
A comparison between the performance of HARPS and ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations Using the same optimized strategy ESPRESSO could find 1 3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of early-K dwarfs In addition 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected
We present new radial velocities from Keck Observatory and both Newtonian and Keplerian solutions for the triple-planet system orbiting HD 37124 The orbital solution for this system has improved dramatically since the third planet was first reported in Vogt et al 2005 with an ambiguous orbital period We have resolved this ambiguity
and the outer two planets have an apparent period commensurability of 2 1 A dynamical analysis finds both resonant and non-resonant configurations consistent with the radial velocity data and constrains the mutual inclinations of the planets to be less than about 30 degrees We discuss HD 37124 in the context of the other 19 exoplanetary systems with apparent period commenserabilities
which we summarize in a table We show that roughly one in three well-characterized multiplanet systems has a apparent low-order period commensuribility which is more than would naively be expected if the periods of exoplanets in known multiplanet systems were drawn randomly from the observed distribution of planetary orbital periods
The gas transport through non-volatile random porous media is investigated numerically We extend our previous research of the transport of molecules inside the uppermost layer of a cometary surface (Skorov and Rickmann 1995; Skorov et al 2001) We assess the validity of the simplified capillary model and its assumptions to simulate the gas flux trough the porous dust mantle as it has been applied in cometary physics
A new microphysical computational model for molecular transport in random porous media formed by packed spheres is presented The main transport characteristics such as the mean free path distribution and the permeability are calculated for a wide range of model parameters and compared with those obtained by more idealized models
The focus in this comparison is on limitations inherent in the capillary model Finally a practical way is suggested to adjust the algebraic Clausing formula taking into consideration the nonlinear dependence of permeability on layer porosity The retrieved dependence allows us to accurately calculate the permeability of layers whose thickness and porosity vary in the range of values expected for the near-surface regions of a cometary nucleus
Planetary magnetic fields could impact the evolution of planetary atmospheres and have a role in the determination of the required conditions for the emergence and evolution of life (planetary habitability) We study here the role of rotation in the evolution of dynamo-generated magnetic fields in massive earth-like planets Super Earths (1-10 $M_\oplus$)
Using the most recent thermal evolution models of Super Earths (Gaidos et al 2010; Tachinami et al 2011) and updated scaling laws for convection-driven dynamos we predict the evolution of the local Rossby number This quantity is one of the proxies for core magnetic field regime i e non-reversing dipolar
reversing dipolar and multipolar We study the dependence of the local Rossby number and hence the core magnetic field regime on planetary mass and rotation rate Previous works have focused only on the evolution of core magnetic fields assuming rapidly rotating planets i e planets in the dipolar regime In this work we go further
including the effects of rotation in the evolution of planetary magnetic field regime and obtaining global constraints to the existence of intense protective magnetic fields in rapidly and slowly rotating Super Earths We find that the emergence and continued existence of a protective planetary magnetic field is not only a function of planetary mass but also depend on rotation rate
Low-mass Super Earths ($M\lesssim 2 M_\oplus$) develop intense surface magnetic fields but their lifetimes will be limited to 2-4 Gyrs for rotational periods larger than 1-4 days On the other hand and also in the case of slowly rotating planets more massive Super Earths ($M\gtrsim 2 M_\oplus$) have weak magnetic fields but their dipoles will last longer
One of the longstanding unsolved problems of planet formation is how solid bodies of a few decimeters in size can &#34;stick&#34; to form large planetesimals This is known as the &#34;meter size barrier&#34; In recent years it has become increasingly clear that some form of &#34;particle trapping&#34; must have played a role in overcoming the meter size barrier
Particles can be trapped in long-lived local pressure maxima such as those in anticyclonic vortices zonal flows or those believed to occur near ice lines or at dead zone boundaries Such pressure traps are the ideal sites for the formation of planetesimals and small planetary embryos Moreover they likely produce large quantities of such bodies in a small region
making it likely that subsequent N-body evolution may lead to even larger planetary embryos The goal of this Letter is to show that this indeed happens and to study how efficient it is In particular we wish to find out if rocky/icy bodies as large as 10 M_earth can form within 1 Myr
Cool M dwarfs outnumber sun-like G stars by ten to one in the solar neighborhood Due to their proximity small size and low mass M-dwarf stars are becoming attractive targets for exoplanet searches via almost all current search methods But what planetary systems can form around M dwarfs? Following up on the Cool Stars~16 Splinter Session &#34;Planet Formation Around M Dwarfs&#34;
Improved photometric sensitivity from space-based telescopes have enabled the detection of phase variations for a small sample of hot Jupiters However exoplanets in highly eccentric orbits present unique opportunities to study the effects of drastically changing incident flux on the upper atmospheres of giant planets Here we expand upon previous studies of phase functions for these planets at optical wavelengths by investigating the effects of orbital inclination on the flux ratio as it interacts with the other effects induced by orbital eccentricity
We search for the astrometric signatures of planets and brown dwarfs known from radial velocity surveys in the improved Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data provided by van Leeuwen (2007a) Our aim is to put more significant constraints on the inclination and the longitude of the ascending node than was possible before
resulting in unambiguous companion masses We fitted the astrometric orbits of 310 substellar companions around 258 stars to the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data Even though the astrometric signatures of the companions cannot be detected in most cases the Hipparcos data still provide lower limits on the inclination for all but 67 of the investigated companions
which translates into upper limits on the masses of the unseen companions For nine companions the derived upper mass limit lies in the planetary and for 75 companions in the brown dwarf mass regime proving the substellar nature of those objects Two of those objects have minimum masses also in the brown dwarf regime and are thus proven to be brown dwarfs
The confirmed planets are the ones around Pollux (beta Gem b) epsilon Eri b epsilon Ret b mu Ara b upsilon And c and d 47 UMa b HD 10647 b and HD 147513 b The confirmed brown dwarfs are HD 137510 b and HD 168443 c In 20 cases
the astrometric signature of the substellar companion was detected in the Hipparcos data Of these 20 companions three are confirmed as planets or lightweight brown dwarfs (HD 87833 b iota Dra b and gamma Cep b) two as brown dwarfs (HD 106252 b and HD 168443 b) and four are low-mass stars (BD -04 782 b
We present new 1--1 25 micron (z and J band) Subaru/IRCS and 2 micron (K band) VLT/NaCo data for HR 8799 and a rereduction of the 3--5 micron MMT/Clio data first presented by Hinz et al (2010) Our VLT/NaCo data yields a detection of a fourth planet at a projected separation of ~ 15 AU -- &#34;HR 8799e&#34;
We also report new albeit weak detections of HR 8799b at 1 03 microns and 3 3 microns Empirical comparisons to field brown dwarfs show that at least HR 8799b and HR8799c and possibly HR 8799d have near-to-mid IR colors/magnitudes significantly discrepant from the L/T dwarf sequence Standard cloud deck atmosphere models appropriate for brown dwarfs provide only (marginally) statistically meaningful fits to HR 8799b and c for unphysically small radii
Models with thicker cloud layers not present in brown dwarfs reproduce the planets&#39; SEDs far more accurately and without the need for rescaling the planets&#39; radii Our preliminary modeling suggests that HR 8799b has log(g) = 4--4 5 Teff = 900K while HR 8799c d and (by inference) e have log(g) = 4--4
Teff = 1000--1200K Combining results from planet evolution models and new dynamical stability limits implies that the masses of HR 8799b c d and e are 6--7 Mj 7--10 Mj 7--10 Mj and 7--10 Mj &#39;Patchy&#34; cloud prescriptions may provide even better fits to the data and may lower the estimated surface gravities and masses
Previous models of the combined growth and migration of protoplanets needed large ad hoc reduction factors for the type I migration rate as found in the isothermal approximation In order to eliminate these factors a simple semi-analytical model is presented that incorporates recent results on the migration of low mass planets in non-isothermal disks
It allows for outward migration The model is used to conduct planetary populations synthesis calculations Two points with zero torque are found in the disks Planets migrate both in- and outward towards these convergence zones They could be important for accelerating planetary growth by concentrating matter in one point We also find that the updated type I migration models allow the formation of both close-in low mass planets
Context The trans-neptunian region of the Solar System is populated by a large variety of icy bodies showing great diversity in orbital behavior size surface color and composition One can also note the presence of dynamical families and binary systems One surprising feature detected in the spectra of some of the largest Trans-Neptunians is the presence of crystalline water-ice
This is the case for the large TNO (136 108) Haumea (2003 EL61) Aims We seek to constrain the state of the water ice of Haumea and its satellites and investigate possible energy sources to maintain the water ice in its crystalline form Methods Spectro-imaging observations in the near infrared have been performed with the integral field spectrograph SINFONI mounted on UT4 at the ESO Very Large Telescope
The spectra of both Haumea and its larger satellite Hi&#39;iaka are analyzed Relative astrometry of the components is also performed providing a check of the orbital solutions and equinox seasons Results We describe the physical characteristics of the crystalline water-ice present on the surface of Haumea and its largest satellite Hi&#39;iaka and analyze possible sources of heating to maintain water in crystalline state
tidal dissipation in the system components vs radiogenic source The surface of Hi&#39;iaka appears to be covered by large grains of water ice almost entirely in its crystalline form Under some restricted conditions both radiogenic heating and tidal forces between Haumea and Hi&#39;iaka could provide the energy sufficient to maintain the ice in its crystalline state
WASP-19b has the shortest orbital period of any known exoplanet orbiting at only 1 2 times the Roche tidal radius By observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect we show that WASP-19b&#39;s orbit is aligned with lambda = 4 6 +/- 5 2 degrees Using in addition a spectroscopic vsini and the observed rotation period we conclude that the obliquity
psi is less than 20 degrees Further the eccentricity of the orbit is less than 0 02 We argue that hot Jupiters with orbital periods as short as that of WASP-19b are two orders of magnitude less common than hot Jupiters at the 3-4-d `pileup&#39; We discuss the evolution of WASP-19b&#39;s orbit and argue that most likely it was first moved to near twice the Roche limit by third-body interactions
One of the persistent complications in searches for transiting exoplanets is the low percentage of the detected candidates that ultimately prove to be planets which significantly increases the load on the telescopes used for the follow-up observations to confirm or reject candidates Several attempts have been made at creating techniques that can pare down candidate lists without the need of additional observations
Some of these techniques involve a detailed analysis of light curve characteristics; others estimate the stellar density or some proxy thereof In this paper we extend upon this second approach exploring the use of independently-calculated stellar densities to identify the most promising transiting exoplanet candidates We use a set of CoRoT candidates and the set of known transiting exoplanets to examine the potential of this approach
The Cassini mission crossed the source region of the Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR) on 17 October 2008 On this occasion the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) experiment detected both local and distant radio sources while plasma parameters were measured in situ by the magnetometer (MAG) and the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS)
A goniopolarimetric inversion was applied to RPWS 3-antenna electric measurements to determine the wave vector k and the complete state of polarization of detected waves We identify broadband extraordinary (X) as well as narrowband ordinary (O) mode SKR at low frequencies Within the source region SKR is emitted just above the X mode cutoff frequency in a hot plasma
with a typical electron-to-wave energy conversion efficiency of 1% (2% peak) The knowledge of the k-vector is then used to derive the locus of SKR sources in the kronian magnetosphere that shows X and O components emanating from the same regions We also compute the associated beaming angle at the source theta&#39;=(k
-B) either from (i) in situ measurements or a model of the magnetic field vector or from (ii) polarization measurements Obtained results similar for both modes suggest quasi-perpendicular emission for local sources whereas the beaming pattern of distant sources appears as a hollow cone with a frequency-dependent constant aperture angle
theta&#39;=75°+/-15° below 300kHz decreasing at higher frequencies to reach theta&#39;(1000kHz)=50°+/-25° Finally we investigate quantitatively the SKR polarization state observed to be strongly elliptical at the source and quasi-purely circular for sources located beyond approximately 2 kronian radii We show that conditions of weak mode coupling are achieved along the ray path
An accumulation of multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra reveal that the nearby star G77-50 is a very cool DAZ white dwarf externally polluted by Mg Fe Al Ca and possibly Na Cr Mn The metallic and hydrogen absorption features all exhibit multiple components consistent with Zeeman splitting in a B~120kG magnetic field
Ultraviolet through infrared photometry combined with trigonometric parallaxes yield Teff=5310K M=0 60Msun and a cooling age of 5 2Gyr The space velocity of the white dwarf suggests possible membership in the Galactic thick disk consistent with an estimated total age of 8 6Gyr G77-50 is spectrally similar to G165-7 and LHS 2534; these three cool white dwarfs comprise a small group exhibiting both metals and magnetism
The photospheric metals indicate accretion of rocky debris similar to that contained in asteroids but the cooling age implies a remnant planetary system should be stable A possibility for G77-50 and similarly old polluted white dwarfs is a recent stellar encounter that dynamically rejuvenated the system from the outside-in Metal abundance measurements for these cooler white dwarfs have the potential to distinguish material originating in outer region planetesimals injected via fly-by
If common envelope evolution can generate magnetic fields in white dwarfs then G77-50 and its classmates may have cannibalized an inner giant planet during prior evolution with their metals originating in terrestrial bodies formed further out Although speculative this scenario can be ruled out if terrestrial planet formation is prohibited in systems where a giant planet has migrated to the inner region nominally engulfed during the post-main sequence
The locations of the fully despun double synchronous end states of tidal evolution are derived for spherical components With the exception of nearly equal-mass binaries binary asteroid systems are in the midst of lengthy tidal evolutions far from their fully synchronous tidal end states Calculations of material strength indicate that binaries in the main belt with 100-km-scale primary components are consistent with being made of monolithic or fractured rock as expected for binaries likely formed from sub-catastrophic impacts in the early solar system
To tidally evolve in their dynamical lifetime near-Earth binaries with km-scale primaries or smaller must be much weaker mechanically than their main-belt counterparts even if formed in the main belt prior to injection into the near-Earth region Small main-belt binaries with primary components less than 10 km in diameter depending on their ages
could either be as strong as large main-belt binaries or as weak as near-Earth binaries because the inherent uncertainty in the age of a binary system can affect the calculation of material strength by orders of magnitude Several other issues are considered though these typically affect the calculation of material strength by no more than a factor of two
Little is known about the physical properties of cometary nuclei Apart from space mission targets measuring the thermal emission of a nucleus is one of the few means to derive its size independently of its albedo and to constrain some of its thermal properties This emission is difficult to detect from Earth but space telescopes (Infrared Space Observatory
Spitzer Space Telescope Herschel Space Observatory) allow reliable measurements in the infrared and the sub-millimetre domains We aim at better characterizing the thermal properties of the nucleus of comet 8P/Tuttle using multi-wavelentgh space- and ground-based observations in the visible infrared and millimetre range We used the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to measure the millimetre thermal emission of comet 8P/Tuttle at 240 GHz (1
We report on the first detection of the millimetre thermal emission of a cometary nucleus since comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp in 1997 Using the two contact spheres shape model derived from Hubble Space Telescope observations we constrained the thermal properties of the nucleus Our millimetre observations are best match with
Around low- and intermediate-mass (1 5-3 M_sun) red giants no planets have been found inside 0 6 AU Such a paucity is not seen in the case of 1 M_sun main sequence stars In this study we examine the possibility that short-period planets were engulfed by their host star evolving off the main sequence
To do so we have simulated the orbital evolution of planets including the effects of stellar tide and mass loss to determine the critical semimajor axis a_crit beyond which planets survive the RGB expansion of their host star We have found that a_crit changes drastically around 2 M_sun In the lower-mass range
a_crit is more than 1 AU while a_crit is as small as about 0 2 AU in the higher-mass range Comparison with measured semimajor axes of known planets suggests that there is a lack of planets that only planet engulfment never accounts for in the higher-mass range Whether the lack is real affects our understanding of planet formation
Space missions to NEOs are being planned at all major space agencies and recently a manned mission to an NEO was announced as a NASA goal Efforts to find and select suitable targets (plus backup targets) are severely hampered by our lack of knowledge of the physical properties of dynamically favorable NEOs
In particular current mission scenarios tend to favor primitive low-albedo objects For the vast majority of NEOs the albedo is unknown <br>Here we report new constraints on the size and albedo of 65 NEOs with rendezvous deltaV &lt; 7 km/s Our results are based on thermal-IR flux data obtained in the framework of our ongoing (2009--2011) ExploreNEOs survey (Trilling et al
